# ADR-006: Publish Data to the Internet Archive

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
BALIZA's mission is to create an "Open Backup." This implies not only collecting the data but also making it publicly available in a permanent and free manner. We need a hosting platform that aligns with these values.

**Decision:**
The **Internet Archive (IA)** will be the primary platform for publishing the datasets generated by BALIZA (the DuckDB file and Parquet exports). The daily CI/CD workflow will be responsible for uploading the updated data.

**Consequences:**
*   **Positive:**
    *   **Mission Alignment:** The IA is a non-profit dedicated to digital preservation, which aligns perfectly with BALIZA's goal.
    *   **Zero Cost and Permanence:** The IA offers free, long-term storage.
    *   **Accessibility:** Data becomes globally accessible via direct URLs, enabling features like remote querying of the DuckDB database.
    *   **Versioning:** The IA maintains a history of file versions, contributing to traceability.
*   **Negative:**
    *   **Speed:** Upload/download speeds may be lower than those of commercial cloud providers like AWS S3 or GCS.
    *   **API:** The IA's management API is less flexible than those of commercial services.
    *   **Dependency:** The project becomes dependent on the continuity and policies of the Internet Archive.
