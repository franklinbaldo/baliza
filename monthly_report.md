# PNCP Data Extraction - Project Status Report

## System Status

The `baliza` extraction system is fully operational and has been refactored to use a robust, task-based architecture.

### ✅ Working Components
- **Phased Extraction**: The extraction process is divided into four phases: Planning, Discovery, Execution, and Reconciliation.
- **Task-Based Architecture**: A DuckDB control table (`pncp_extraction_tasks`) manages the state of the extraction process, ensuring resilience and idempotency.
- **Asynchronous Extraction**: The script uses `httpx` and `asyncio` for high-performance, concurrent data extraction.
- **Local Data Storage**: Raw API responses are stored in a DuckDB database (`psa.pncp_raw_responses`).
- **Data Transformation**: dbt models are used to transform the raw data into a structured format for analysis.
- **Rich Progress Display**: The `rich` library provides detailed and accurate progress bars for each phase of the extraction.
- **Error Handling and Graceful Shutdown**: The script is designed to handle errors gracefully and can be safely interrupted and resumed.

### 🔧 Recent Improvements
- **New Architecture**: The entire extraction process was refactored to be more robust and resilient.
- **Improved Documentation**: The `README.md` and dbt models have been updated to reflect the new architecture.
- **Code Readability**: The code has been reorganized and is now easier to understand and maintain.

## Extraction Process

The extraction process is now managed by the `pncp_extractor.py` script and can be run using the `baliza` CLI.

### Progress Bar Format

The command now shows clear progress for each phase and endpoint:

```
Phase 2: Discovery
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% • 188/188
Phase 3: Execution
[green]Contratos por Data de Publicação[/green] - [dim]48 pages[/dim]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% • 48/48
[blue]Contratos por Data de Atualização Global[/blue] - [dim]48 pages[/dim]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% • 48/48
[cyan]Atas de Registro de Preço por Período de Vigência[/cyan] - [dim]48 pages[/dim]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% • 48/48
[bright_cyan]Atas por Data de Atualização Global[/bright_cyan] - [dim]48 pages[/dim]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% • 48/48
```

### Endpoint Coverage
- `contratos_publicacao`: Contract publication data
- `contratos_atualizacao`: Contract updates
- `atas_periodo`: Price registration records by period
- `atas_atualizacao`: Price registration records updates

## Data Analysis

The extracted data is processed and transformed using dbt, resulting in a set of tables ready for analysis.

### Data Models
- **Bronze**: Raw JSON data is parsed and cleaned.
- **Silver**: Data is structured into fact and dimension tables.
- **Gold**: An analytics mart (`mart_procurement_analytics`) is created for BI and analysis.

## Command Usage

```bash
# Run the complete extraction process
uv run baliza extract

# The command automatically:
# 1. Initializes the DuckDB database and tables.
# 2. Plans the extraction tasks for all endpoints and date ranges.
# 3. Discovers the total number of pages for each task.
# 4. Executes the download of all pages.
# 5. Reconciles the downloaded data and updates the task status.
```

## Next Steps

The system is now fully operational and ready for:
- **Production use**: Reliable data extraction from the PNCP.
- **Scheduled runs**: Can be automated for regular data updates.
- **Data analysis**: The `mart_procurement_analytics` table provides a solid foundation for data analysis.
- **Monitoring**: The task control table allows for detailed monitoring of the extraction process.

## Conclusion

The `baliza` project has been significantly improved with a new, robust, and resilient extraction architecture. The system is now more reliable and easier to maintain, providing a solid foundation for building a comprehensive public procurement data warehouse.
