Of course. After analyzing your extensive codebase, I can provide a clear, actionable plan to simplify and strengthen it.

Your project, "Baliza," is ambitious and has many great components: data ingestion, Internet Archive federation, dbt transformations, CI/CD, and even a separate analytics sandbox. However, this has led to significant complexity and some overlapping responsibilities.

The core principle for simplification will be to **enforce strict separation of concerns**.

### The Core Problem: Over-Complexity and Blended Responsibilities

1.  **Too Many Scripts:** You have a `scripts` directory with over 10 different scripts, many of which are for testing, formatting, or one-off tasks. This makes the main data pipeline logic hard to find and follow.
2.  **Multiple Ingestion Logics:** There are several files attempting to test or fetch data from the API (`test_api_call.py`, `test_new_endpoints.py`, `simple_endpoint_test.py`, `enhanced_endpoint_test.py`, and `main.py`). This creates confusion and redundancy.
3.  **Complex dbt Models:** Your dbt models (`coverage/`) are performing highly complex *analytical* queries (calculating rolling averages, data gaps, entity status). This logic belongs in a separate analytics project, not the core data ingestion pipeline.
4.  **Convoluted Data Flow:** The `ia_federation.py` and `main.py` interact in complex ways, with the main script trying to manage federation updates. This makes the core ingestion process brittle.
5.  **Extensive CI/CD:** Your `code_quality.yml` is excellent but very long and includes many custom checks that could be simplified or standardized.

### The Simplification Plan: A 4-Step Refactoring

Here’s how we'll apply the best practices we discussed to your existing codebase.

#### Step 1: Consolidate and Simplify the Ingestion Logic

The biggest win will be to unify all data fetching into a single, configuration-driven script.

**Action:**
1.  **Create a new, authoritative ingestion script:** `scripts/ingestion.py`.
2.  **Adopt the configuration-driven pattern:** Take the `ENDPOINTS_TO_DOWNLOAD` list from my previous answer and adapt it to your `main.py` logic. This list will define every endpoint, its parameters, and its output name.
3.  **Delete redundant scripts:** Once `scripts/ingestion.py` is working, delete the following files as their functionality will be fully replaced or is no longer needed:
    *   `src/baliza/simple_endpoint_test.py`
    *   `src/baliza/enhanced_endpoint_test.py`
    *   `scripts/test_api_call.py`
    *   `scripts/test_new_endpoints.py`
    *   `scripts/test_pncp_endpoint.py`
4.  **Refactor `src/baliza/main.py`:**
    *   Rename it to `src/baliza/cli.py` to make its purpose clear.
    *   Remove all data harvesting logic from it. Its only job should be to parse command-line arguments (`--date`, `--auto`, etc.) and call the main function in `scripts/ingestion.py`.

**New `scripts/ingestion.py` (Conceptual):**
```python
# scripts/ingestion.py
from src.baliza.config import ENDPOINTS_CONFIG # Centralized config
from src.baliza.fetcher import fetch_data_for_endpoint
from src.baliza.loader import save_to_parquet, upload_to_ia

def run_ingestion(date: str):
    """The single entry point for all data ingestion."""
    for endpoint_name, config in ENDPOINTS_CONFIG.items():
        data = fetch_data_for_endpoint(date, config)
        if data:
            filepath = save_to_parquet(data, endpoint_name, date)
            upload_to_ia(filepath, config)
```

#### Step 2: Refocus the dbt Project on Core Transformations

Your dbt project should only do one thing: **transform raw data into clean, well-structured tables (staging layer)**. All complex analytics and coverage metrics should be removed.

**Action:**
1.  **Delete the `dbt_baliza/models/analytics/` and `dbt_baliza/models/coverage/` directories.** These models are too complex for the core pipeline.
    *   `dashboard_metrics.sql`
    *   `coverage_endpoint_year.sql`
    *   `coverage_entidades.sql`
    *   `coverage_temporal.sql`
2.  **Move the logic** from these deleted models to your `sandbox/baliza-analytics/` project. The analytics project is the *consumer* of the clean data; it's the right place for these analyses.
3.  **Simplify `dbt_baliza/models/staging/stg_contratos.sql`:**
    *   Its only job is to clean, cast types, and rename columns from a single source file (e.g., `contratos_publicacao.parquet`).
    *   Remove complex logic like `JSON_EXTRACT_STRING`. Instead, the Python ingestion script should flatten the JSON *before* saving to Parquet, so dbt receives clean columns.
4.  **Update `dbt_baliza/models/sources/sources.yml`:**
    *   Define each Parquet file from your ingestion script as a source. The identifier should point directly to the file path.
    ```yaml
    sources:
      - name: pncp_raw_data
        tables:
          - name: contratos_publicacao
            identifier: "read_parquet('path/to/raw_data/contratos_publicacao_*.parquet')"
    ```

#### Step 3: Decouple Internet Archive (IA) Federation

The IA federation is a powerful feature for *reading* data, but it should not be tightly coupled with the *writing* (ingestion) process.

**Action:**
1.  **Make `ia_federation.py` a standalone utility.** It should have its own CLI commands (`discover`, `update-catalog`) and not be called directly from the main ingestion script.
2.  **The CI/CD pipeline should run it as a separate step:**
    *   **Step 1:** Run `scripts/ingestion.py` to download today's data and save it.
    *   **Step 2:** Run a separate command like `python src/baliza/ia_federation.py update-catalog` to refresh the DuckDB views based on the *current* state of the Internet Archive.

This decouples the two processes. The ingestion can succeed even if the IA API is down, and the federation catalog can be rebuilt at any time without re-downloading data.

#### Step 4: Streamline the Project Structure and CI/CD

Consolidate files and simplify workflows to reflect the new, clearer responsibilities.

**Action:**
1.  **Merge `scripts/` and `src/baliza/`:** Your core application logic is small enough to live in one place. Move the new `ingestion.py` and `cli.py` into `src/baliza/`. The `scripts/` directory can be reserved for utility/helper scripts like formatting.
2.  **Simplify `pyproject.toml`:** Remove the separate `[project.scripts]` entry for `baliza` and rely on a single entry point.
3.  **Refactor `.github/workflows/baliza_daily_run.yml`:**
    *   **Job 1: Ingest Data**
        *   Checks out code, installs dependencies.
        *   Runs `python src/baliza/cli.py --auto`.
        *   Uploads the raw Parquet files and a run summary as an artifact.
    *   **Job 2: Transform Data (depends on Job 1)**
        *   Downloads the raw data artifact.
        *   Runs `dbt build`.
        *   Uploads the final `baliza.duckdb` as an artifact.
    *   **Job 3: Update Federation & Deploy Docs (depends on Job 2)**
        *   Runs `python src/baliza/ia_federation.py update-catalog`.
        *   Runs the scripts to generate the `cobertura.html` and deploy to GitHub Pages.

### Simplified Codebase (Conceptual)

After refactoring, your project will look much cleaner:

```
baliza/
├── .github/workflows/           # --- Simplified CI/CD with clear jobs
│   └── daily_run.yml
├── dbt_baliza/                  # --- dbt project, FOCUSED ON STAGING ONLY
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── staging/
│   │   │   ├── stg_contratos.sql
│   │   │   └── schema.yml
│   │   └── sources.yml
│
├── src/baliza/                  # --- All core Python logic in one place
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── cli.py                  # --- Typer CLI entry point
│   ├── ingestion.py            # --- The ONLY data ingestion script
│   ├── config.py               # --- Central endpoint configuration
│   ├── fetcher.py              # --- API call logic
│   ├── loader.py               # --- Parquet/IA saving logic
│   └── ia_federation.py        # --- Standalone federation utility
│
├── sandbox/baliza-analytics/    # --- Unchanged, but now has a clearer purpose
│   └── ... (All analytical logic, including the old coverage models)
│
└── tests/                       # --- Simplified tests for the new structure
    └── ...
```

This revised structure makes your project more modular, easier to maintain, and aligns perfectly with modern data engineering best practices. The core pipeline is simple and robust, while the complex analytics are isolated in their own environment.
