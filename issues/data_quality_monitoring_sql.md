*   **Hardcoded Table and Column Names:** The `monitor_data_quality` and `create_transparency_report` macros have hardcoded table and column names (e.g., `numero_controle_pncp`, `valor_inicial`, `data_assinatura`). This makes the macros less reusable for other models or datasets. These should be passed as arguments or derived dynamically.
*   **Limited Anomaly Detection Logic:** The `monitor_data_quality` macro only checks for zero and negative values. This is a very limited set of anomaly detection rules. A more comprehensive data quality monitoring system would include checks for uniqueness, completeness, validity, consistency, and timeliness.
*   **Mixing of Concerns:** The `create_transparency_report` macro mixes data quality checks with general data profiling (e.g., `total_records`, `unique_contracts`). These concerns should be separated into different macros or models.
*   **SQL Injection Vulnerability in `monitor_data_quality`:** The `table_name` and `column_name` arguments are directly interpolated into the SQL query without proper sanitization. This makes the macro vulnerable to SQL injection attacks if a malicious user can control these arguments.
*   **Lack of Dynamic Column Selection:** The `create_transparency_report` macro hardcodes the columns to be analyzed. A more flexible approach would allow users to specify which columns to include in the report.
*   **Redundant `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW`:** While `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` is useful, the macros generate views with fixed names (e.g., `_quality_monitor`, `_transparency_report`). If these macros are called multiple times for different columns or models, they will overwrite previous views, leading to loss of historical data quality metrics. A more robust solution would involve generating unique view names or materializing these as tables with a history.
*   **`validate_relationships_with_monitoring` Macro:** This macro is intended to validate relationships but instead of failing, it creates a monitoring view. This is a good approach for data preservation, but the macro name is a bit misleading as it implies validation. It should be renamed to reflect its monitoring purpose (e.g., `monitor_orphaned_records`).
