# Analysis of `scripts/init_dbt_tables.py`

This script initializes DuckDB tables for a dbt-driven task planning system.

## Issues Found

1.  **Hardcoded Database Path:** The `db_path` is hardcoded in the `init_planning_tables` function. This should be configurable, for example, via command-line arguments.
2.  **Hardcoded Schema and Table Names:** The schema and table names are hardcoded in the SQL statements. This makes the script less flexible if the schema changes.
3.  **Bare `except Exception`:** The `try...except` blocks for adding foreign key constraints use a bare `except Exception`, which is too broad. It's better to catch more specific exceptions.
4.  **No Logging:** The script uses `print` for output. It would be better to use a proper logging library for more structured and configurable logging.
5.  **No `main` function:** The script does not have a `main` function, and the `init_planning_tables` function is called directly in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block.
6.  **Unused `sys` import:** The `sys` module is imported but never used.
7.  **Path Manipulation:** The script modifies `sys.path` to import modules from the `src` directory. This is generally not a good practice. It's better to install the project as a package or use a different project structure.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Command-Line Arguments:** Use `argparse` or a similar library to make the database path and other settings configurable.
*   **Configuration File:** For more complex setups, consider using a configuration file (e.g., YAML) to define the database schema.
*   **Specific Exception Handling:** Use more specific exception handling to provide better error messages and make the script more robust.
*   **Logging:** Use the `logging` module for better logging.
*   **Add `main` function:** Add a `main` function to encapsulate the script's logic and make it more reusable.
*   **Remove unused imports:** Remove the unused `sys` import.
*   **Refactor Path Manipulation:** Avoid modifying `sys.path`. Instead, consider using a project structure that allows for direct imports or installing the project as a package.

Overall, the script is functional and serves its purpose. The suggestions above are aimed at improving its flexibility, robustness, and maintainability.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Add a `main` function:**
    *   Use `argparse` to add a command-line argument for the database path.
    *   Use a `try...except` block to handle `FileNotFoundError` if the database path does not exist.
    *   Use a logging library to log the progress of the script.
*   **Refactor `init_planning_tables`:**
    *   Move the SQL statements to separate `.sql` files.
    *   Use a configuration file to define the database schema.
    *   Use more specific exception handling for database operations.
    *   Add a docstring and type hints to the function.
*   **Remove Path Manipulation:**
    *   Remove the `sys.path.append` call.
    *   Install the project as a package or use a different project structure to allow for direct imports.
