# Analysis of `src/baliza/__init__.py`

This file is the `__init__.py` file for the `baliza` package.

## Architectural Issues

None.

## Code Quality Issues

None.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Expose Public API:** The `__init__.py` file could be used to expose the public API of the `baliza` package. For example, you could add the following lines to the file:

    ```python
    from .extractor import AsyncPNCPExtractor
    from .pncp_client import PNCPClient
    from .pncp_writer import PNCPWriter
    ```

    This would allow users to import these classes directly from `baliza` instead of their respective modules.

Overall, the `__init__.py` file is a standard part of a Python package and doesn't have any issues. The suggestion above is a matter of style and can be implemented to improve the usability of the package.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Add the following lines to the `__init__.py` file:**

    ```python
    from .extractor import AsyncPNCPExtractor
    from .pncp_client import PNCPClient
    from .pncp_writer import PNCPWriter
    ```
