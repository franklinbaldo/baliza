# Analysis of `docs/api_investigation/discover_modalidades.py`

This file contains a script to discover available "modalidades de contratação" from the PNCP API.

## Issues Found

1.  **Hardcoded Range:** The script only tests for `modalidade_id` in the range `1` to `20`. This might not be exhaustive, and new modalities might be added in the future. A better approach would be to either increase the range or find a more dynamic way to discover the upper limit.

2.  **Sequential Requests:** The script makes sequential requests to the API with a `0.5s` delay. This is polite, but it can be slow. Since the requests are independent, they could be run in parallel using `asyncio.gather` to speed up the discovery process.

3.  **JSON Output in Root:** The script saves the output file `modalidades_discovered.json` in the root directory. It would be better to save it in a more organized location, like a `data` or `output` folder.

4.  **No Error Handling for File I/O:** The script doesn't handle potential `IOError` or other exceptions when writing the output file.

5.  **Redundant `has_data` key:** The `has_data` key in the result dictionary is redundant, as it can be inferred from `total_records > 0`.

6.  **Lack of Type Hinting in `discover_modalidades`:** The `discover_modalidades` function lacks a return type hint.

7.  **Magic Numbers:** The script uses magic numbers like `7` (days), `10.0` (timeout), `20` (range), `1`, `10`, `200`, `422`, `0.5`. These should be defined as constants with descriptive names.

8.  **Inconsistent String Formatting:** The script uses both f-strings and the `%` operator for string formatting. It would be better to stick to one style (preferably f-strings).

9.  **No Docstrings for `discover_modalidades`:** The `discover_modalidades` function has a comment instead of a proper docstring.

10. **Unused `test_date` variable**: The `test_date` variable is calculated but only used inside the `params` dictionary. It could be inlined.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   Implement parallel requests using `asyncio.gather`.
*   Make the range of modalities to test configurable.
*   Define constants for magic numbers.
*   Add proper error handling for file operations.
*   Improve code style and consistency.
*   Add proper docstrings and type hints.
*   Save output to a dedicated directory.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Refactor `test_modalidade`:**
    *   Extract the URL and other constants to the top of the file.
    *   Use a `try...except` block to handle `httpx.RequestError` and other exceptions.
    *   Use a single `return` statement to return the result dictionary.
*   **Refactor `discover_modalidades`:**
    *   Use `asyncio.gather` to run the `test_modalidade` function in parallel for all modalities.
    *   Add a command-line argument to specify the range of modalities to test.
    *   Add a command-line argument to specify the output directory for the results file.
    *   Use a `with` statement to open the output file and handle potential `IOError` exceptions.
    *   Use a logging library to log the progress of the script.
