# Analysis of `scripts/generate_endpoint_seeds.py`

This script generates dbt seed files from a YAML configuration file.

## Issues Found

1.  **Hardcoded Paths:** The paths to the configuration file and the output seed files are hardcoded. This makes the script less flexible. They should be configurable via command-line arguments.
2.  **Hardcoded Modalidade Names:** The `modalidade_names` dictionary is hardcoded in the `generate_modalidades_seed` function. This should be loaded from a separate configuration file or a more robust source, like Python enums as hinted in the comments.
3.  **Bare `except Exception`:** The `load_endpoints_config` and `main` functions use a bare `except Exception`, which is too broad. It's better to catch more specific exceptions.
4.  **Redundant `exit` call:** The `exit` call in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block is redundant, as the `main` function already returns an exit code.
5.  **Noisy `main` function:** The `main` function does not have a docstring that explains what it does.
6.  **Unused `logger` variable:** The `logger` variable is created but it is not used in the whole file.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Command-Line Arguments:** Use `argparse` or a similar library to make the input and output paths configurable.
*   **Externalize Modalidade Names:** Load the modalidade names from a separate configuration file (e.g., a YAML or JSON file) to make them easier to manage.
*   **Specific Exception Handling:** Use more specific exception handling to provide better error messages and make the script more robust.
*   **Remove redundant code:** Remove the redundant `exit` call in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block.
*   **Add docstrings:** Add a docstring to the `main` function to explain its purpose.
*   **Remove unused variables:** The `logger` variable is not used anywhere in the file and should be removed.
*   **Type Hinting:** The `main` function could have a return type hint.

Overall, the script is well-structured and serves its purpose. The suggestions above are mostly for improving its flexibility, usability, and maintainability.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Refactor `main`:**
    *   Use `argparse` to add command-line arguments for the configuration file path and the output directory.
    *   Use a `try...except` block to handle `FileNotFoundError` if the configuration file does not exist.
    *   Use a logging library to log the progress of the script.
*   **Refactor `generate_endpoints_seed` and `generate_modalidades_seed`:**
    *   Move the logic for loading the configuration to a separate function.
    *   Move the logic for writing the CSV files to a separate function.
    *   Load the modalidade names from a separate configuration file.
    *   Add docstrings and type hints to the functions.
