## `explorer.py`: Simulated Data in Data Explorer

### Problem

The `DataExplorer` in `src/baliza/ui/explorer.py` uses simulated or hardcoded data in several of its interactive views. This includes:

*   `_explore_by_categories`: The procurement categories and their statistics are hardcoded.
*   `_explore_by_agencies`: The agency statistics are hardcoded.
*   `_search_data`: The search functionality is not implemented and just displays a "coming soon" message.
*   `_get_insights`: Many of the insights are hardcoded.

This limits the utility of the data explorer, as it doesn't currently provide a true picture of the data in the database.

### Potential Solutions

1.  **Implement Real Data Fetching and Analysis**:
    *   The simulated data needs to be replaced with real data fetched from the database.
    *   This will likely involve writing new SQL queries to aggregate and analyze the data in the `psa` and dbt-generated tables.
    *   For example, the "explore by categories" view should query the gold-level tables to get the actual contract categories and their associated statistics.
    *   The search functionality needs to be implemented to allow users to perform full-text searches or filtered queries against the data.

### Recommendation

Replace all simulated data in the data explorer with real, data-driven queries and analysis. This will make the explorer a powerful tool for interactive data analysis. This will require a significant amount of work to write the necessary SQL queries and to implement the search functionality. The queries should be designed to be efficient, as they will be run interactively.
