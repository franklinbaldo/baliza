# Analysis of `src/baliza/ui/components.py`

This file provides reusable UI components for the BALIZA CLI.

## Architectural Issues

None. This is a well-defined UI component library with a clear purpose.

## Code Quality Issues

1.  **Hardcoded Styles:** The styles for the UI components are hardcoded as strings (e.g., `"[header]{title}[/header]"`). This makes it difficult to change the theme of the application.
2.  **Duplicate Code:** There is some duplicate code for creating tables and panels. This could be refactored into helper functions.
3.  **Noisy `LiveProgress` class:** The `LiveProgress` class does not have a docstring that explains what it does.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Use a Theming System:** Instead of hardcoding styles, use a theming system to define the styles for the UI components. This will make it easier to change the theme of the application.
*   **Refactor Duplicate Code:** Refactor the duplicate code for creating tables and panels into helper functions.
*   **Add docstrings:** Add a docstring to the `LiveProgress` class to explain its purpose.

Overall, the `components.py` file is a well-written and functional UI component library. The suggestions above are aimed at improving its flexibility and maintainability.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Create a `Theme` class:**
    *   This class will be responsible for defining the theme of the application.
    *   It will have attributes for colors, icons, and styles.
*   **Refactor UI components:**
    *   The UI components will take a `Theme` object as input.
    *   They will use the `Theme` object to get the styles for the components.
*   **Refactor duplicate code:**
    *   Create a `create_panel` helper function to create panels with a consistent style.
*   **Add docstrings and type hints to all classes and functions.**
