# Analysis of `src/baliza/ui/dashboard.py`

This file provides the main dashboard for the BALIZA application.

## Architectural Issues

1.  **Mixing UI and Data Logic:** The `Dashboard` class mixes UI code (e.g., creating panels and tables) with data retrieval logic (e.g., querying the database). This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the code harder to test.
2.  **Hardcoded SQL Queries:** The SQL queries are hardcoded as strings. This makes them difficult to maintain and test. They should be moved to separate `.sql` files or a dedicated query module.
3.  **Simulated Data:** The `_get_quick_insights` and `_get_pipeline_health` methods return simulated data. This makes the dashboard less useful and misleading. The dashboard should display real data from the system.

## Code Quality Issues

1.  **Bare `except Exception`:** The `_get_database_stats`, `_get_quick_insights`, and `_get_storage_stats` methods use a bare `except Exception`, which is too broad. It's better to catch more specific exceptions.
2.  **Long Methods:** Some of the methods in the `Dashboard` class are too long and complex, such as `_get_database_stats`. They should be broken down into smaller, more focused methods.
3.  **Noisy `_create_welcome_header` method:** The `_create_welcome_header` method does not have a docstring that explains what it does.
4.  **Noisy `_format_status` method:** The `_format_status` method does not have a docstring that explains what it does.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Separate UI and Data Logic:** Create a separate `DataProvider` class to handle the data retrieval logic. The `Dashboard` class should then use the `DataProvider` to get the data it needs to display.
*   **Externalize SQL Queries:** Move the SQL queries to separate `.sql` files or a dedicated query module.
*   **Use Real Data:** The dashboard should display real data from the system. The `_get_quick_insights` and `_get_pipeline_health` methods should be updated to query the database for real data.
*   **Specific Exception Handling:** Use more specific exception handling to provide better error messages and make the script more robust.
*   **Refactor Long Methods:** Break down the long methods into smaller, more focused methods.
*   **Add docstrings:** Add docstrings to all methods to explain their purpose.

Overall, the `dashboard.py` file is a good starting point, but it needs a significant refactoring to improve its architecture and code quality. The suggestions above will help to make the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Create a `DataProvider` class:**
    *   This class will be responsible for retrieving data from the database.
    *   It will have methods for getting database stats, quick insights, storage stats, and pipeline health.
*   **Refactor `Dashboard`:**
    *   The `Dashboard` class will be responsible for displaying the dashboard.
    *   It will use the `DataProvider` to get the data it needs to display.
    *   It will have methods for creating the welcome header, status overview, quick insights, and quick actions panels.
*   **Externalize SQL Queries:**
    *   Move the SQL queries to separate `.sql` files.
    *   Use a query builder or an ORM to build the queries.
*   **Use Real Data:**
    *   Update the `_get_quick_insights` and `_get_pipeline_health` methods to query the database for real data.
*   **Add docstrings and type hints to all methods.**
