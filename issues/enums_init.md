# Analysis of `src/baliza/enums/__init__.py`

This file provides utility functions for working with enums and a registry for dynamically accessing them.

## Architectural Issues

None. This is a well-defined enum utility module with a clear purpose.

## Code Quality Issues

1.  **Global Enum Registry:** The use of a global enum registry (`ENUM_REGISTRY`) is not ideal. It would be better to pass the registry object as a parameter to the functions that need it.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Pass Enum Registry as a Parameter:** Pass the enum registry object as a parameter to the functions that need it, instead of using a global instance.

Overall, the `__init__.py` file is a well-written and functional enum utility module. The suggestion above is aimed at improving its flexibility and maintainability.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Create an `EnumRegistry` class:**
    *   This class will be responsible for managing the enum registry.
    *   It will have methods for registering enums, getting enums by name, and getting all enum metadata.
*   **Refactor enum utility functions:**
    *   The enum utility functions will take an `EnumRegistry` object as input.
    *   They will use the `EnumRegistry` object to get the enum classes.
*   **Add docstrings and type hints to all functions.**
