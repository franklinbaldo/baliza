# Analysis of `src/baliza/enums/geral.py`

This file defines several general-purpose enums.

## Architectural Issues

None. This is a well-defined enum module with a clear purpose.

## Code Quality Issues

None. The code is well-written and follows best practices for defining enums.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Add Docstrings:** The enums could be improved by adding docstrings to explain the meaning of each enum and its members.
*   **Use a More Descriptive Naming Convention:** The names of the enums and their members could be more descriptive. For example, `CategoriaProcesso` could be renamed to `ProcessCategory`.

Overall, the `geral.py` file is a well-written and functional enum module. The suggestions above are aimed at improving its clarity and readability.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Add docstrings to all enums and their members.**
*   **Rename the enums and their members to be more descriptive.**
