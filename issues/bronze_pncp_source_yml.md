## `baliza/dbt_baliza/models/bronze/bronze_pncp_source.yml`

*   **Hardcoded Schema Name:** The `schema: psa` is hardcoded. While this is consistent with `pncp_writer.py`, it limits flexibility if the schema name needs to change in different environments or deployments. It would be better to make this configurable, perhaps through a dbt variable or by referencing the `psa_schema` variable defined in `dbt_project.yml`.
*   **Redundant Table Definitions:** The `pncp_raw_responses` table is described as a "Legacy table for backwards compatibility - will be deprecated after migration." While its presence is explained, it still adds to the complexity of the source definition. Once the migration is complete, this definition should be removed.
*   **Implicit Data Types:** While dbt infers data types from the database, explicitly defining them in the `columns` section (e.g., `type: UUID`, `type: TEXT`, `type: INTEGER`) would improve clarity and provide an additional layer of documentation and validation.
*   **Lack of `relationships` Test for `pncp_raw_responses`:** The `pncp_requests` table has a `relationships` test to `pncp_content`. However, the `pncp_raw_responses` table, which is also a source, does not have any `relationships` tests defined, even if it has implicit relationships with other tables.
*   **No `not_null` Test for `response_content` in `pncp_content`:** The `response_content` column in `pncp_content` is described as "The actual response content (deduplicated)." However, there is no `not_null` test defined for this column. While `pncp_writer.py` handles empty responses by storing an empty string, ensuring non-null content at the dbt level would be a good practice.
*   **No `not_null` Test for `response_content` in `pncp_raw_responses`:** Similar to `pncp_content`, the `response_content` column in `pncp_raw_responses` also lacks a `not_null` test.
*   **No `not_null` Test for `request_parameters` and `response_headers`:** These columns are described as JSON objects, but they don't have `not_null` tests. While they might be empty JSON objects, ensuring they are not `NULL` would be a good practice.
