# Analysis of `src/baliza/utils/json_utils.py`

This file provides a utility function for parsing JSON with a fallback mechanism.

## Architectural Issues

None. This is a simple utility module with a clear purpose.

## Code Quality Issues

1.  **Unnecessary Fallback:** The fallback to the standard `json` library might not be necessary. `orjson` is generally more robust and faster than the standard library. The fallback adds complexity and might hide issues that should be addressed directly. If there are specific edge cases where `orjson` fails, they should be documented and handled explicitly.
2.  **Noisy `logger` variable:** The `logger` variable is created but it is not used in the whole file.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Remove the Fallback:** Consider removing the fallback to the standard `json` library and relying solely on `orjson`. This will simplify the code and make it more consistent. If there are specific reasons for the fallback, they should be clearly documented.
*   **Remove unused variables:** The `logger` variable is not used anywhere in the file and should be removed.

Overall, the `json_utils.py` file is a simple and functional utility module. The suggestions above are aimed at simplifying the code and making it more robust.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Remove the fallback to the standard `json` library.**
*   **Remove the `logger` variable.**
*   **Add a docstring to the `parse_json_robust` function.**
*   **Add type hints to the function signature.**
