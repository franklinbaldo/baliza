# Analysis of `src/baliza/cli.py`

This file defines the command-line interface for the BALIZA application using `typer`.

## Architectural Issues

1.  **Monolithic File:** The `cli.py` file is a monolithic file that contains the entire CLI application. This makes it difficult to navigate and maintain. It would be better to split the CLI into multiple files, one for each command group.
2.  **Mixing UI and Logic:** The file mixes UI code (e.g., `create_header`, `create_info_panel`) with business logic (e.g., calling the extractor, transformer, and loader). This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the code harder to test.
3.  **Late Imports:** The use of late imports (e.g., `from . import loader, mcp_server, transformer`) can make the code harder to understand and debug. It's better to have all imports at the top of the file.
4.  **Global Shutdown Flag:** The use of a global shutdown flag (`_shutdown_requested`) is not ideal. It would be better to pass the shutdown event as a parameter to the functions that need it.

## Code Quality Issues

1.  **Long Functions:** Many of the functions in the `cli.py` file are too long and complex, such as `extract`, `transform`, and `load`. They should be broken down into smaller, more focused functions.
2.  **Duplicate Code:** There is a lot of duplicate code for creating headers and panels. This could be refactored into a helper function.
3.  **Hardcoded Strings:** There are many hardcoded strings in the UI code. These should be moved to a separate configuration file or a dedicated UI module.
4.  **Noisy `setup_signal_handlers` function:** The `setup_signal_handlers` function does not have a docstring that explains what it does.
5.  **Noisy `ETLPipelineStep` class:** The `ETLPipelineStep` class does not have a docstring that explains what it does.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Split the CLI into Multiple Files:** Create a `commands` directory and put each command group in its own file. For example, you could have `commands/extract.py`, `commands/transform.py`, and `commands/load.py`.
*   **Separate UI and Logic:** Move the UI code to a separate `ui` module. The CLI functions should then call the UI functions to display information to the user.
*   **Move Imports to the Top:** Move all imports to the top of the file to make the code easier to read and understand.
*   **Pass Shutdown Event as a Parameter:** Pass the shutdown event as a parameter to the functions that need it, instead of using a global flag.
*   **Refactor Long Functions:** Break down the long functions into smaller, more focused functions.
*   **Refactor Duplicate Code:** Refactor the duplicate code for creating headers and panels into a helper function.
*   **Externalize Strings:** Move the hardcoded strings to a separate configuration file or a dedicated UI module.
*   **Add docstrings:** Add docstrings to all functions and classes to explain their purpose.

Overall, the `cli.py` file is a good starting point, but it needs a significant refactoring to improve its architecture and code quality. The suggestions above will help to make the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Create a `commands` directory:**
    *   Create a `commands` directory to hold the CLI command groups.
    *   Create `extract.py`, `transform.py`, and `load.py` files in the `commands` directory.
*   **Refactor `cli.py`:**
    *   Move the `extract`, `transform`, and `load` commands to their respective files in the `commands` directory.
    *   The `cli.py` file will then be responsible for creating the main `Typer` app and adding the command groups from the `commands` directory.
*   **Create a `ui` module:**
    *   Move the UI-related code (e.g., `create_header`, `create_info_panel`) to a separate `ui` module.
*   **Use a `Shutdown` class:**
    *   Create a `Shutdown` class to manage the shutdown event.
    *   Pass the `Shutdown` object as a parameter to the functions that need it.
*   **Refactor long functions:**
    *   Break down the long functions into smaller, more focused functions.
    *   For example, the `extract` function could be broken down into `_show_extract_header`, `_show_extract_config`, and `_run_extraction`.
*   **Externalize strings:**
    *   Move the hardcoded strings to a separate `strings.py` file or a configuration file.
*   **Add docstrings and type hints to all functions and classes.**
