# Analysis of `src/baliza/dependencies.py`

This file provides a dependency injection container for the BALIZA CLI.

## Architectural Issues

1.  **Global Container Instance:** The use of a global container instance (`_container`) is not ideal. It would be better to pass the container object as a parameter to the functions that need it.
2.  **Late Imports:** The use of late imports in `create_default_container` can make the code harder to understand and debug. It's better to have all imports at the top of the file.

## Code Quality Issues

1.  **Noisy `ExtractorProtocol` protocol:** The `ExtractorProtocol` protocol does not have a docstring that explains what it does.
2.  **Noisy `TransformerProtocol` protocol:** The `TransformerProtocol` protocol does not have a docstring that explains what it does.
3.  **Noisy `LoaderProtocol` protocol:** The `LoaderProtocol` protocol does not have a docstring that explains what it does.
4.  **Noisy `DependencyContainer` class:** The `DependencyContainer` class does not have a docstring that explains what it does.
5.  **Noisy `CLIServices` class:** The `CLIServices` class does not have a docstring that explains what it does.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Pass Container as a Parameter:** Pass the container object as a parameter to the functions that need it, instead of using a global instance.
*   **Move Imports to the Top:** Move all imports to the top of the file to make the code easier to read and understand.
*   **Add docstrings:** Add docstrings to all protocols and classes to explain their purpose.

Overall, the `dependencies.py` file is a well-designed and functional dependency injection module. The suggestions above are aimed at improving its flexibility and clarity.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Remove the global container instance.**
*   **Pass the container as a parameter to the `get_cli_services` function.**
*   **Move the imports in `create_default_container` to the top of the file.**
*   **Add docstrings to all protocols and classes.**
