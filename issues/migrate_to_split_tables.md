# Analysis of `scripts/migrate_to_split_tables.py`

This script migrates data from a monolithic table to a split table architecture with content deduplication. It's a well-structured and comprehensive script.

## Issues Found

1.  **Hardcoded Table Names:** The table names `psa.pncp_raw_responses`, `psa.pncp_content`, and `psa.pncp_requests` are hardcoded throughout the script. This makes it less flexible if the schema changes.
2.  **Potential for Large Memory Usage:** The `content_cache` dictionary in `migrate_data_batch` could grow large if the batch size is very large and there's a lot of unique content. This could lead to high memory consumption.
3.  **Bare `except Exception`:** The `connect_database` and `print_migration_summary` methods use a bare `except Exception`, which is too broad. It's better to catch specific exceptions.
4.  **Noisy `main` function:** The `main` function does not have a docstring that explains what it does.
5.  **Lack of `return` in `create_migration_tables` function:** The `create_migration_tables` does not have a `return` statement in case of a `dry_run`.
6.  **Redundant `exit` call:** The `exit` call in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block is redundant, as the `main` function already returns an exit code.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Configuration:** Make table names and other settings configurable, either through command-line arguments or a configuration file.
*   **Memory Management:** For very large datasets, consider using a more memory-efficient caching strategy, such as an LRU cache with a fixed size, or a disk-based cache.
*   **Error Handling:** Use more specific exception handling to provide better error messages and make the script more robust.
*   **Code Organization:** The script is quite long. It could be beneficial to break it down into smaller, more focused modules (e.g., for database interactions, migration logic, and reporting).
*   **Add docstrings:** Add a docstring to the `main` function to explain its purpose.
*   **Add `return` statement:** Add a `return` statement to the `create_migration_tables` function to make it more explicit.
*   **Remove redundant code:** Remove the redundant `exit` call in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block.

Overall, this is a very good script that demonstrates a solid understanding of data migration and performance considerations. The suggestions above are minor and aimed at further improving its robustness and maintainability.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Refactor `SplitTableMigrator`:**
    *   Move the `SplitTableMigrator` class to a separate `migrator.py` file.
    *   Move the `analyze_existing_data` and `print_migration_summary` methods to a separate `reporting.py` file.
    *   Move the database interaction logic to a separate `db.py` file.
*   **Add a `main` function:**
    *   Use `argparse` to add command-line arguments for the database path, batch size, and dry run flag.
    *   Allow loading table names from a configuration file.
*   **Refactor `migrate_data_batch`:**
    *   Use a more memory-efficient caching strategy for the `content_cache`.
    *   Use more specific exception handling for database operations.
