# Analysis of `src/baliza/plan_fingerprint.py`

This file contains the `PlanFingerprint` class, which is responsible for generating and validating plan fingerprints.

## Architectural Issues

None. This is a well-defined utility module with a clear purpose.

## Code Quality Issues

1.  **Hardcoded Configuration File Path:** The `load_config` function has a hardcoded default path to the `endpoints.yaml` file. This makes the code less flexible and harder to test.
2.  **Noisy `get_endpoint_config`, `get_all_active_endpoints` and `load_config` imports:** The `get_endpoint_config`, `get_all_active_endpoints` and `load_config` functions are imported but never used.
3.  **Noisy `yaml` import:** The `yaml` module is imported but never used.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Make Configuration File Path Configurable:** The path to the `endpoints.yaml` file should be configurable, for example, through an environment variable or a command-line argument.
*   **Remove Unused Imports:** The unused imports should be removed to improve code clarity.

Overall, the `plan_fingerprint.py` file is a well-written and functional utility module. The suggestions above are aimed at improving its flexibility and maintainability.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Make Configuration File Path Configurable:**
    *   Add a `config_path` setting to the `config.py` file.
    *   Use the `config_path` setting in the `load_config` function.
*   **Remove Unused Imports:**
    *   Remove the `get_endpoint_config`, `get_all_active_endpoints`, and `yaml` imports.
*   **Add docstrings and type hints to all functions.**
