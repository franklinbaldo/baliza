## `baliza/dbt_baliza/models/gold/gold_schema.yml`

*   **Incomplete Schema Definition:** The `gold_schema.yml` file only defines schemas for `mart_procurement_analytics` and `mart_compras_beneficios`. It is missing schema definitions for other potential gold layer models. This leads to a lack of documentation and validation for these models.
*   **Generic Column Descriptions:** The column descriptions are quite generic (e.g., "Total number of contracts", "Total contract value"). While accurate, they could be more specific about the aggregation logic or the source of the data.
*   **Hardcoded `dbt_utils.expression_is_true` Tests:** Similar to previous schema files, the use of `dbt_utils.expression_is_true` for basic sanity checks (e.g., `">= 0"`) is present. While flexible, more specific dbt tests or custom generic tests could provide better readability and clarity.
*   **Missing `not_null` Test for `avg_contract_value`:** The `avg_contract_value` column in `mart_procurement_analytics` has a description but is missing a `not_null` test. If this column is expected to always have a value, a `not_null` test should be added.
*   **Implicit Dependency on `transparency_monitoring` Source:** The `transparency_monitoring` source is defined, but its purpose and how it relates to the gold layer models are not immediately clear. It seems to be a source for data quality monitoring, but its inclusion in the gold schema file might be confusing.
*   **No `description` for `models`:** The top-level `models` section in `dbt_project.yml` defines descriptions for layers (e.g., `planning`, `runtime`), but this `gold_schema.yml` only defines descriptions for individual models. It would be beneficial to have a high-level description for the entire gold layer within this file.
