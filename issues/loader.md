# Analysis of `src/baliza/loader.py`

This file handles the "load" command by exporting data to Parquet and uploading to the Internet Archive.

## Architectural Issues

1.  **Hardcoded Configuration:** The `DEFAULT_EXPORT_SCHEMAS` and `REQUIRED_CREDENTIALS` are hardcoded. This makes it difficult to configure the loader without modifying the code.
2.  **Mixing Concerns:** The `load` function mixes the logic for exporting data to Parquet with the logic for uploading to the Internet Archive. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Code Quality Issues

1.  **Bare `except Exception`:** The `export_to_parquet` and `upload_to_internet_archive` functions use a bare `except Exception`, which is too broad. It's better to catch more specific exceptions.
2.  **Noisy `logger` variable:** The `logger` variable is created but it is not used in the whole file.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Externalize Configuration:** Move the `DEFAULT_EXPORT_SCHEMAS` and `REQUIRED_CREDENTIALS` to a separate configuration file (e.g., a YAML or JSON file).
*   **Separate Concerns:** Create separate `Exporter` and `Uploader` classes to handle the logic for exporting data to Parquet and uploading to the Internet Archive, respectively. The `load` function should then use these classes to perform its work.
*   **Specific Exception Handling:** Use more specific exception handling to provide better error messages and make the script more robust.
*   **Remove unused variables:** The `logger` variable is not used anywhere in the file and should be removed.

Overall, the `loader.py` file is a good starting point, but it needs a significant refactoring to improve its architecture and code quality. The suggestions above will help to make the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Create a `config` module:**
    *   This module will be responsible for loading the configuration from a YAML or JSON file.
    *   It will have a `get_export_schemas` function that returns the list of schemas to export.
    *   It will have a `get_required_credentials` function that returns the list of required credentials.
*   **Create an `Exporter` class:**
    *   This class will be responsible for exporting data to Parquet.
    *   It will have an `export` method that takes a list of schemas as input and returns a dictionary with the export results.
*   **Create an `Uploader` class:**
    *   This class will be responsible for uploading data to the Internet Archive.
    *   It will have an `upload` method that takes the number of retries as input and returns a dictionary with the upload results.
*   **Refactor `load`:**
    *   The `load` function will be responsible for loading the data.
    *   It will use the `Exporter` and `Uploader` classes to perform its work.
*   **Remove unused variables:**
    *   Remove the `logger` variable.
*   **Add docstrings and type hints to all functions.**
