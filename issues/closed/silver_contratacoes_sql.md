## `baliza/dbt_baliza/models/silver/silver_contratacoes.sql`

*   **Hardcoded Endpoint Category:** Similar to `silver_atas.sql`, the `WHERE endpoint_category = 'contratacoes'` clause hardcodes the filtering. This creates a tight coupling and reduces flexibility.
*   **Direct JSON Key Access:** The model directly accesses JSON keys (e.g., `procurement_data ->> 'numeroControlePNCP'`). This creates a brittle dependency on the exact structure of the incoming JSON. A more robust approach would involve using dbt macros for JSON extraction or a more structured approach.
*   **Repetitive `CASE` Statements for Enum Mapping:** The model uses extensive `CASE` statements to map integer IDs to their corresponding names for `modalidade_id`, `modo_disputa_id`, and `tipo_instrumento_convocatorio_codigo`. This is a direct duplication of the enum definitions in `baliza/src/baliza/enums.py` and `baliza/config/endpoints.yaml`. This logic should be centralized, ideally by joining with a dbt seed table derived from the Python enums, or by using a dbt macro that can dynamically generate these mappings. This approach is brittle and prone to inconsistencies if the enum values change.
*   **Lack of Centralized JSON Extraction Logic for Nested Objects:** Nested JSON fields like `orgao_entidade_json`, `unidade_orgao_json`, `amparo_legal_json`, and `fontes_orcamentarias_json` are extracted as raw JSON. While this is a valid silver layer strategy, if these nested structures are common across multiple silver models, a centralized macro or a dedicated staging model for flattening would improve consistency and reusability.
*   **`incremental_strategy: 'delete+insert'`:** As noted in `bronze_pncp_raw.sql`, `delete+insert` can be inefficient for large tables. Consider alternative incremental strategies based on data volume and update patterns.
*   **Reliance on `extracted_at` for Incremental Logic:** The incremental logic relies on `extracted_at`. This assumes that `extracted_at` is always increasing and that new data is always "newer" than existing data. If data can be backfilled or updated out of order, this incremental strategy might miss or duplicate records. A more robust incremental strategy would involve a watermark column or a combination of columns that guarantee uniqueness and order.
*   **`ROW_NUMBER()` for `record_index`:** The `ROW_NUMBER()` function is used to generate a `record_index` partitioned by `response_id`. This is similar to the issue in `silver_atas.sql` and might not guarantee global uniqueness if `numero_controle_pncp` is the `unique_key`.
*   **Implicit Data Quality Assumptions:** The model implicitly assumes data quality for various fields (e.g., `valorTotalEstimado` can be cast to `DOUBLE`). Explicit data quality checks and tests should be implemented.
*   **No Column Descriptions:** New columns created in this model (e.g., `endpoint_category`, `response_json`, `procurement_json`) do not have descriptions defined within the model or in a corresponding `yml` file. This makes it harder to understand the purpose and content of these columns for downstream users.
