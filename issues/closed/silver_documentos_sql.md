*   **Hardcoded `tipo_referencia` and `data_inclusao_referencia`:** The `tipo_referencia` is hardcoded as 'contratacao' and `data_inclusao_referencia` is directly taken from `data_inclusao` of `silver_contratacoes`. This limits the model to only processing documents related to `contratacoes`. The comment "Adicionar outras fontes (atas, contratos) aqui no futuro" indicates that this is a known limitation, but the current implementation makes it difficult to extend. A more flexible approach would involve a macro or a union of multiple sources with dynamic `tipo_referencia` and `data_inclusao_referencia` values.
*   **Hardcoded `CASE` Statement for `tipo_documento_nome`:** The model uses a `CASE` statement to map `tipo_documento_id` to `tipo_documento_nome`. This is a direct duplication of the enum definition in `baliza/src/baliza/enums.py`. This logic should be centralized, ideally by joining with a dbt seed table derived from the Python enums, or by using a dbt macro that can dynamically generate these mappings. This approach is brittle and prone to inconsistencies if the enum values change.
*   **`unique_key='documento_key'` with `doc_data ->> 'id'`:** The `documento_key` is derived from `doc_data ->> 'id'`. This assumes that the `id` field within the `documentos` array is globally unique across all `contratacoes` and other potential sources. If `id` is only unique within a `procurement_json`, then `documento_key` will not be unique, leading to issues with the `delete+insert` incremental strategy. A more robust unique key would involve a composite key including `numero_controle_pncp` and `doc_data ->> 'id'`.
*   **Reliance on `data_inclusao` for Incremental Logic:** The incremental logic relies on `data_inclusao` from `silver_contratacoes`. This assumes that `data_inclusao` is always increasing and that new documents are always "newer" than existing ones. If documents can be backfilled or updated out of order, this incremental strategy might miss or duplicate records.
*   **Direct JSON Key Access:** The model directly accesses JSON keys (e.g., `doc_data ->> 'id'`). This creates a brittle dependency on the exact structure of the incoming JSON. A more robust approach would involve using dbt macros for JSON extraction or a more structured approach.
*   **No Column Descriptions:** New columns created in this model (e.g., `documento_key`, `tipo_referencia`, `data_inclusao_referencia`, `tipo_documento_nome`) do not have descriptions defined within the model or in a corresponding `yml` file. This makes it harder to understand the purpose and content of these columns for downstream users.
