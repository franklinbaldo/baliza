## `task_claimer.py` - UPDATED

**Status:** âœ… PARTIALLY RESOLVED - Some issues addressed in recent implementation

### âœ… Resolved:
*   **Hardcoded `db_path`:** âœ… FIXED - The `__init__` method now properly accepts `db_path` as a parameter
*   **Fingerprint validation separation:** âœ… IMPROVED - Plan fingerprint validation is now handled through `plan_fingerprint.py`

### ðŸ”§ Still Relevant:
*   **Hardcoded dbt Command:** The `create_task_plan` function still hardcodes the `dbt` command. This should be made more configurable through settings.
*   **Complex Error Handling:** The `claim_pending_tasks` method still has complex error handling logic that mixes different concerns. Needs refactoring for consistency.
*   **Hardcoded SQL:** The file still contains hardcoded SQL queries. These should be moved to a separate file or a data access layer.
*   **Leaky Abstraction:** The `create_task_plan` function remains a leaky abstraction. Should be encapsulated in a separate class or module.

### ðŸ“ˆ Priority: MEDIUM
These remaining issues affect maintainability but don't block functionality.
