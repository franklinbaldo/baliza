## `baliza/dbt_baliza/models/planning/task_plan_meta.sql`

*   **Hardcoded Default Dates and Environment:** Similar to `task_plan.sql`, this model uses hardcoded default values for `plan_start_date`, `plan_end_date`, and `plan_environment`. These defaults can be misleading and should ideally be managed more centrally or be more generic.
*   **Dependency on `run_started_at`:** The `plan_version` and `generated_at` columns directly use dbt's internal `run_started_at` variable. While common in dbt, it tightly couples the plan metadata to the dbt run timestamp, which might not always align with a logical versioning scheme for the plan itself.
*   **Implicit `plan_version` Format:** The `plan_version` is constructed via string concatenation (`{{ var("plan_environment", "prod") }}-{{ run_started_at.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") }}.1`). While `planning_schema.yml` describes its format, there's no explicit validation here, increasing the risk of inconsistent version strings.
*   **`materialized: table` for Metadata:** Materializing `task_plan_meta` as a `table` means it's recreated on each run. If the intention is to maintain a historical log of all generated plan metadata, an `incremental` materialization strategy would be more appropriate to append new records.
*   **`unique_key: 'plan_version'`:** While `plan_version` is intended to be unique, its reliance on `run_started_at` could lead to collisions if multiple dbt runs occur within the same second. Using `plan_fingerprint` as the `unique_key` might be more robust for tracking unique configurations, or a composite key if `plan_version` is truly meant to be a sequential identifier per run.
*   **`config_version` Variable:** The model uses a `config_version` variable. While good for tracking configuration changes, its source and update mechanism are not clear from this file. It should be part of a well-defined configuration management strategy.
