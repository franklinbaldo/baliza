*   **Hardcoded Default Dates:** The `start_date` and `end_date` variables have hardcoded default values (`2023-01-01` and `2024-12-31`). While these can be overridden, having such specific defaults in the model definition can be misleading and might not align with the actual desired date range for a given execution. These defaults should ideally be managed more centrally or be more generic (e.g., `current_date - interval '1 year'`).
*   **Implicit Dependency on `generate_task_plan` Macro:** The model relies entirely on the `generate_task_plan` macro. While this is the purpose of the macro, the SQL file itself provides no insight into how the task plan is generated. This makes the model less transparent and harder to debug without looking at the macro definition.
*   **Redundant Index Definition:** The `indexes` configuration in the `config` block defines indexes. While this is a dbt feature, the `pncp_writer.py` also creates indexes for the `pncp_extraction_tasks` table. This redundancy can lead to inconsistencies or unnecessary re-indexing if not carefully managed. The dbt project should be the single source of truth for index definitions.
*   **`materialized: table` for Planning:** Materializing the `task_plan` as a `table` means that a new table is created or replaced on each run. For a planning table, it might be more efficient to use an `incremental` materialization strategy if the goal is to add new tasks without re-generating the entire plan, or a `view` if the plan is always generated on the fly. The current setup implies a full regeneration, which might be inefficient for large plans.
