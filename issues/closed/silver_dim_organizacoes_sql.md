*   **Repetitive CTEs for Source Data:** The model uses four separate CTEs (`org_from_contracts`, `org_from_procurements`, `subrog_from_contracts`, `subrog_from_procurements`) to extract organization data from `silver_contratos` and `silver_contratacoes`. This is highly repetitive. A more efficient and maintainable approach would be to create a single staging model that unions all relevant JSON fields from the bronze layer, and then extract the organization data from that unified staging model.
*   **Hardcoded `extract_organization_data` Macro Usage:** The model directly calls the `extract_organization_data` macro with hardcoded JSON field names and prefixes. This creates a tight coupling with the macro and the JSON structure.
*   **`UNION ALL` for Deduplication:** The `all_organizations` CTE uses `UNION ALL` followed by `SELECT DISTINCT` in `deduplicated_organizations`. This is an inefficient way to deduplicate records. A `UNION` (which implicitly deduplicates) or a `GROUP BY` clause would be more efficient.
*   **Hardcoded `poder_id` and `esfera_id` Mapping:** The `poder_nome` and `esfera_nome` are derived using `CASE` statements with hardcoded mappings. These mappings should be defined in a dbt seed file or a separate dimension table to ensure consistency and maintainability.
*   **`MD5` for Surrogate Key:** The `MD5(org_cnpj)` is used as a surrogate key. While MD5 is a common choice, it's not collision-resistant. For a dimension table, a more robust surrogate key generation strategy (e.g., `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key` or a sequence) might be preferred, especially if `org_cnpj` is not guaranteed to be unique or if there's a risk of collisions.
*   **Lack of Incremental Materialization:** The model is materialized as a `table`. For a dimension table that might grow over time, an `incremental` materialization strategy would be more efficient to only process new or changed organizations.
*   **No Column Descriptions:** New columns created in this model (e.g., `org_key`, `poder_nome`, `esfera_nome`) do not have descriptions defined within the model or in a corresponding `yml` file. This makes it harder to understand the purpose and content of these columns for downstream users.
