*   **Hardcoded Joins and JSON Extraction:** The model performs multiple `LEFT JOIN` operations with `silver_dim_organizacoes` and `silver_dim_unidades_orgao` using direct JSON key access (e.g., `c.orgao_entidade_json ->> 'cnpj'`). This creates a brittle dependency on the exact JSON structure and the naming conventions of the dimension tables. A more robust approach would be to use dbt macros for joining or a more structured approach to flatten the JSON in a preceding staging model.
*   **Repetitive `CASE` Statements for Derived Attributes:** The model uses extensive `CASE` statements to derive attributes like `tipo_pessoa_descricao`, `faixa_valor_global`, and `faixa_duracao_vigencia`. This is a direct duplication of business logic that should ideally be centralized in dbt macros, seed tables, or a dedicated transformation layer. This approach is brittle and prone to inconsistencies if the business rules change.
*   **Hardcoded Value Ranges for `faixa_valor_global` and `faixa_duracao_vigencia`:** The `faixa_valor_global` and `faixa_duracao_vigencia` `CASE` statements use hardcoded value ranges. These ranges should be defined in a dbt seed file or a separate configuration to make them easily configurable and maintainable.
*   **Hardcoded `quality_flag` Logic:** The `quality_flag` uses hardcoded conditions to identify data quality issues. While useful, this logic should be externalized into dbt tests or a dedicated data quality monitoring framework to ensure consistency and reusability across models.
*   **`MD5` for Surrogate Key:** The `MD5(numero_controle_pncp)` is used as a surrogate key. While MD5 is a common choice, it's not collision-resistant. For a fact table, a more robust surrogate key generation strategy (e.g., `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key` or a sequence) might be preferred, especially if `numero_controle_pncp` is not guaranteed to be unique or if there's a risk of collisions.
*   **No Column Descriptions:** New columns created in this model (e.g., `contract_key`, `duracao_vigencia_dias`, `tipo_contrato_id`, `tipo_contrato_nome`, `categoria_processo_id`, `categoria_processo_nome`, `tipo_pessoa_descricao`, `faixa_valor_global`, `faixa_duracao_vigencia`, `quality_flag`) do not have descriptions defined within the model or in a corresponding `yml` file. This makes it harder to understand the purpose and content of these columns for downstream users.
*   **`materialized: table`:** The model is materialized as a `table`. For a fact table that might grow over time, an `incremental` materialization strategy would be more efficient to only process new or changed contracts.
