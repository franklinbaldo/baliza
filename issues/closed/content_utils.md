## `content_utils.py`

*   **Hardcoded Namespace UUID:** The `BALIZA_NAMESPACE` is a hardcoded UUID. While this is necessary for the deterministic generation of UUIDs, it would be better to load this from a configuration file to make it clear that it's a configurable value, even if it rarely changes.
*   **Redundant `analyze_content` Function:** The `analyze_content` function calculates the content hash and then the content ID from that hash. The `generate_content_id` function also calculates the content hash internally. This means the hash is calculated twice when `analyze_content` is called. This is a minor performance issue, but it could be avoided by having `generate_content_id` optionally accept a pre-computed hash.
*   **Lack of Extensibility:** The hashing algorithm (SHA-256) is hardcoded. While this is acceptable for this specific use case, a more extensible design would allow for different hashing algorithms to be used in the future.
