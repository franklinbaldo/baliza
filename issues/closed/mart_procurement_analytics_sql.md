## `baliza/dbt_baliza/models/gold/mart_procurement_analytics.sql`

*   **Redundant Joins to Dimension Tables:** The `procurement_summary` CTE joins `silver_fact_contratacoes` with `silver_dim_organizacoes` and `silver_dim_unidades_orgao`. These joins are already performed in `silver_fact_contratacoes.sql` to bring in the `org_key` and `unit_key`. The dimension attributes (e.g., `org.cnpj`, `org.razao_social`) should ideally be brought into the fact table in the silver layer, or a dedicated dimension model should be created for these attributes, to avoid redundant joins in the gold layer.
*   **Hardcoded `CASE` Statements for Categorization:** The model uses extensive `CASE` statements to categorize `modalidade_id`, `org_esfera`, and `org_poder`. This is a direct duplication of business logic that should ideally be centralized in dbt macros, seed tables, or a dedicated transformation layer. This approach is brittle and prone to inconsistencies if the business rules change.
*   **`incremental_strategy: 'delete+insert'`:** While `delete+insert` is a valid incremental strategy, it can be inefficient for very large tables. Consider `merge` or `append` with a unique constraint if applicable.
*   **Reliance on `data_publicacao_pncp` for Incremental Logic:** The incremental logic relies on `data_publicacao_pncp`. This assumes that `data_publicacao_pncp` is always increasing and that new procurements are always "newer" than existing ones. If data can be backfilled or updated out of order, this incremental strategy might miss or duplicate records.
*   **Hardcoded `modalidade_id` Mapping:** The `categoria_modalidade` `CASE` statement hardcodes the mapping of `modalidade_id` to its category. This is a direct duplication of the enum definition in `baliza/src/baliza/enums.py` and `baliza/config/endpoints.yaml`. This logic should be centralized, ideally by joining with a dbt seed table derived from the Python enums, or by using a dbt macro that can dynamically generate these mappings.
*   **Hardcoded `indicador_qualidade` Logic:** The `indicador_qualidade` uses hardcoded conditions to identify data quality issues. While useful, this logic should be externalized into dbt tests or a dedicated data quality monitoring framework to ensure consistency and reusability across models.
*   **No Column Descriptions:** New columns created in this model (e.g., `total_contratos`, `valor_total_contratos`, `percentual_execucao_financeira`, `categoria_modalidade`, `indicador_qualidade`) do not have descriptions defined within the model or in a corresponding `yml` file. This makes it harder to understand the purpose and content of these columns for downstream users.
*   **Implicit Dependency on `silver_fact_contratos` and `silver_fact_contratacoes`:** The model joins `silver_fact_contratacoes` and `silver_fact_contratos` based on `numero_controle_pncp`. This implies a relationship between procurements and contracts that should be explicitly defined and tested.
