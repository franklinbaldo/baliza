## `baliza/config/endpoints.yaml`

*   **Redundant Endpoint Definitions:** The `pncp_endpoints` list in `config.py` and the `endpoints` section in `endpoints.yaml` contain similar information. This redundancy can lead to inconsistencies if changes are made in one place but not the other. The `endpoints.yaml` should be the single source of truth for endpoint configurations.
*   **Hardcoded `modalidades` Values:** The `modalidades` lists within the `contratacoes_publicacao` and `contratacoes_atualizacao` endpoints contain hardcoded integer values. These values correspond to the `ModalidadeContratacao` enum in `enums.py`. This creates a tight coupling between the configuration and the enum definition. It would be better to reference the enum values symbolically or generate this list dynamically from the enum.
*   **Lack of Schema Validation:** There is no explicit schema validation for this YAML file. This means that typos or incorrect data types could lead to runtime errors that are difficult to debug. A JSON Schema or similar validation mechanism would improve robustness.
*   **Mixing of Configuration Types:** The file mixes API endpoint definitions with environment-specific overrides and fingerprinting exclusions. While related, separating these concerns into different files or more clearly delineated sections could improve readability and maintainability.
*   **Implicit `granularity`:** The `granularity` field is present for each endpoint but its usage is not immediately clear from this file alone. It's likely used by the dbt planning models, but its purpose and valid values should be documented.
*   **`page_size_override` is Empty:** The `page_size_override` in the `environments` section is an empty dictionary. If it's not used, it should be removed. If it's intended for future use, a comment explaining its purpose would be helpful.
