## `enums.py`

*   **Large Number of Enums:** The file contains a large number of enums. While this is necessary to represent the data from the PNCP API, it makes the file long and difficult to navigate. Consider splitting the enums into multiple files based on their domain (e.g., `contratos_enums.py`, `atas_enums.py`).
*   **Manual `ENUM_REGISTRY`:** The `ENUM_REGISTRY` is manually created and maintained. This is error-prone and requires developers to remember to add new enums to the registry. This could be automated by using a metaclass or a decorator to automatically register the enums.
*   **Redundant Utility Functions:** The file contains a number of utility functions for working with enums (`get_enum_by_value`, `get_enum_name_by_value`, etc.). While these are useful, they could be moved to a more general-purpose `utils.py` file to avoid cluttering the `enums.py` file.
