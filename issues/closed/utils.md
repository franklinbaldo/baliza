## `utils.py`

*   **Limited Scope:** The `utils.py` file currently only contains a single function for JSON parsing. As the project grows, it's common for `utils.py` files to become dumping grounds for unrelated functions. It would be beneficial to organize utility functions into more specific modules as they accumulate (e.g., `json_utils.py`, `date_utils.py`, `string_utils.py`).
*   **Implicit Dependency on `orjson`:** The `parse_json_robust` function has an implicit dependency on `orjson`. While it gracefully falls back to the standard `json` library, the primary intent is to use `orjson`. If `orjson` is a core dependency, it should be explicitly listed in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`. If it's an optional performance optimization, this should be clearly documented.
*   **Error Handling Granularity:** The `parse_json_robust` function catches `orjson.JSONDecodeError` and `json.JSONDecodeError`. While this is correct, the `logger.exception` call for the final fallback might be too broad if other `Exception` types could theoretically be raised by `json.loads` (though unlikely for `JSONDecodeError`). It's generally good practice to catch the most specific exception possible.
