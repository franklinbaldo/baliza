## `pncp_task_planner.py`

*   **Tight Coupling with `settings`:** The `plan_tasks` method is tightly coupled with the global `settings` object. This makes it difficult to test the planner with different configurations. The `settings` object should be passed in as an argument.
*   **Mixing of Concerns:** The `PNCPTaskPlanner` class is responsible for both generating the task plan and interacting with the database to check for existing tasks. These concerns should be separated. The database interaction should be handled by a separate data access layer.
*   **Mixing UI and Logic:** The use of `rich.console.Console` mixes presentation logic with the core task planning functionality. This module should use logging instead, leaving the user-facing output to the `cli.py` module.
*   **Complex `plan_tasks` Method:** The `plan_tasks` method is long and complex, with nested loops and conditional logic. This makes it difficult to understand and maintain. It should be broken down into smaller, more focused methods.
*   **Implicit Dependency on `writer_conn`:** The `plan_tasks` method has an implicit dependency on the `writer_conn` object. This dependency is not explicit in the constructor of the class, which makes it difficult to understand the dependencies of the class.
