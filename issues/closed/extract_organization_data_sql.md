*   **Hardcoded JSON Keys:** The macros directly access JSON keys like `cnpj`, `razaoSocial`, `ufNome`, `codigo`, `nome`, `id`. This creates a tight coupling between the dbt models and the structure of the incoming JSON data. If the upstream API changes its JSON structure, these macros will break. A more robust solution would involve defining these JSON paths in a central configuration or using a more flexible JSON parsing approach.
*   **Repetitive Structure:** The macros `extract_organization_data`, `extract_unit_data`, `extract_legal_framework_data`, and `extract_type_data` have very similar structures, differing only in the specific JSON keys and prefixes. This indicates an opportunity for a more generic macro that can take a list of fields to extract.
*   **Lack of Type Safety:** The macros rely on implicit type casting (e.g., `CAST(... AS INTEGER)`). While dbt handles this, explicit type definitions or validation would improve data quality and prevent unexpected errors if the incoming data types change.
*   **Limited Error Handling:** The macros do not include any error handling for cases where the JSON keys might be missing or the data is malformed. This could lead to null values or errors in the downstream models.
*   **No Documentation for Expected JSON Structure:** The macros assume a specific JSON structure for the input `json_field`. This expected structure is not documented anywhere, making it difficult for other developers to understand how to use these macros or what kind of data they expect.
