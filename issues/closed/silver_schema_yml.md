## `baliza/dbt_baliza/models/silver/silver_schema.yml`

*   **Incomplete Schema Definition:** The `silver_schema.yml` file only defines schemas for `silver_contratos`, `silver_dim_organizacoes`, `silver_dim_unidades_orgao`, and `silver_fact_contratos`. It is missing schema definitions for `silver_atas`, `silver_contratacoes`, `silver_documentos`, and `silver_itens_contratacao`. This leads to a lack of documentation and validation for these models.
*   **Redundant Column Definitions:** The `numero_controle_pncp` column is defined in both `silver_contratos` and `silver_fact_contratos`. While they are related, if they refer to the same logical entity, consider defining it once in a shared place or ensuring consistency through a macro.
*   **Hardcoded `accepted_values` for `tipo_pessoa`:** The `tipo_pessoa` column in `silver_contratos` uses `accepted_values` with hardcoded strings (`'FÍSICA'`, `'JURIDICA'`, `'JURÍDICA'`). This is brittle and prone to inconsistencies if the values change or if there are other valid values not listed. It would be better to derive these values from a dbt seed table or an enum. Also, there's a typo (`JURIDICA` and `JURÍDICA`).
*   **Generic `dbt_utils.expression_is_true` Tests:** While `dbt_utils.expression_is_true` is flexible, using it for basic sanity checks like `">= 0"` or `">= '2000-01-01'"` can make the tests less readable and harder to understand at a glance compared to more specific dbt tests (if available) or custom generic tests.
*   **Missing `not_null` Test for `unit_key` in `silver_fact_contratos`:** The `unit_key` in `silver_fact_contratos` has a `relationships` test but is missing a `not_null` test. If `unit_key` is expected to always have a value, a `not_null` test should be added.
*   **Inconsistent `description` for `silver_fact_contratos`:** The description for `silver_fact_contratos` is "Contract fact table with foreign keys to dimensions", but the model name is `silver_fact_contratos`, which implies it's for `contratos` (contracts), not `contratacoes` (procurements). This is confusing, especially since there's also a `silver_fact_contratacoes.sql` model. The description should accurately reflect the content of the model.
*   **No `description` for `models`:** The top-level `models` section in `dbt_project.yml` defines descriptions for layers (e.g., `planning`, `runtime`), but this `silver_schema.yml` only defines descriptions for individual models. It would be beneficial to have a high-level description for the entire silver layer within this file.
