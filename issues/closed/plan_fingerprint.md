## `plan_fingerprint.py`

*   **Hardcoded Configuration Path:** The `__init__` method of the `PlanFingerprint` class has a hardcoded default path to the `endpoints.yaml` file. This makes the class less reusable and harder to test. The path should be passed in as an argument.
*   **Lack of a Clear Contract for Configuration:** The code assumes a certain structure for the `endpoints.yaml` file. This contract is not explicitly defined anywhere, which can make it difficult to understand and maintain the configuration file. A schema (e.g., using JSON Schema or Pydantic) would make the contract explicit and allow for validation.
*   **Mixing of Concerns:** The `PlanFingerprint` class is responsible for both generating fingerprints and loading the configuration. These concerns should be separated into different classes.
*   **Redundant `get_endpoint_config` and `get_all_active_endpoints` Functions:** These functions are helpers for accessing the configuration, but they are not directly related to the fingerprinting logic. They should be moved to a more appropriate module, such as `config.py`.
