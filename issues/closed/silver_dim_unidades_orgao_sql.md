## `baliza/dbt_baliza/models/silver/silver_dim_unidades_orgao.sql`

*   **Repetitive CTEs for Source Data:** Similar to `silver_dim_organizacoes.sql`, this model uses four separate CTEs to extract unit data from `silver_contratos` and `silver_contratacoes`. This is highly repetitive and inefficient. A single staging model that unions all relevant JSON fields from the bronze layer, and then extracts the unit data from that unified staging model, would be more efficient and maintainable.
*   **Hardcoded `extract_organization_data` and `extract_unit_data` Macro Usage:** The model directly calls these macros with hardcoded JSON field names and prefixes. This creates a tight coupling with the macros and the JSON structure.
*   **`UNION ALL` for Deduplication:** The `all_units` CTE uses `UNION ALL` followed by `SELECT DISTINCT` in `deduplicated_units`. This is an inefficient way to deduplicate records. A `UNION` (which implicitly deduplicates) or a `GROUP BY` clause would be more efficient.
*   **Hardcoded UF and Region Mapping:** The `uf_sigla_normalizada` and `regiao` are derived using `CASE` statements with hardcoded mappings. These mappings should be defined in a dbt seed file or a separate dimension table to ensure consistency and maintainability.
*   **`MD5` for Surrogate Key:** The `MD5(org_cnpj || '|' || unit_codigo_unidade)` is used as a composite surrogate key. While MD5 is a common choice, it's not collision-resistant. For a dimension table, a more robust surrogate key generation strategy (e.g., `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key` or a sequence) might be preferred, especially if the combination of `org_cnpj` and `unit_codigo_unidade` is not guaranteed to be unique or if there's a risk of collisions.
*   **Lack of Incremental Materialization:** The model is materialized as a `table`. For a dimension table that might grow over time, an `incremental` materialization strategy would be more efficient to only process new or changed units.
*   **No Column Descriptions:** New columns created in this model (e.g., `unit_key`, `uf_sigla_normalizada`, `regiao`) do not have descriptions defined within the model or in a corresponding `yml` file. This makes it harder to understand the purpose and content of these columns for downstream users.
