## `baliza/dbt_baliza/profiles.yml`

*   **Hardcoded `DATA_DIR` Default:** The `path` for the DuckDB database uses `env_var('DATA_DIR', '../data')`. While using an environment variable is good, the default fallback to `../data` is a hardcoded relative path. This can lead to issues if the dbt project is run from a different working directory. It would be better to define this path more robustly, perhaps relative to the project root or through a more explicit configuration.
*   **Redundant Profile Definitions:** The `dev` and `prod` profiles are almost identical, differing only in the `threads` setting. This redundancy can make it harder to maintain the profiles, especially if more settings are added in the future. Consider using dbt's variable interpolation or a base profile to reduce duplication.
*   **Implicit Dependency on `DATA_DIR` Environment Variable:** The profiles rely on the `DATA_DIR` environment variable. While this is a common pattern, it's an implicit dependency that might not be immediately obvious to new developers. It should be clearly documented in the project's setup instructions.
*   **Hardcoded `search_path`:** The `search_path` is hardcoded to `psa`. This couples the dbt project to a specific schema name in the DuckDB database. It would be more flexible to make this configurable, especially if the project needs to interact with different schemas in the future.
*   **Hardcoded `extensions`:** The `extensions` are hardcoded. While these might be necessary for the project's functionality, it would be more flexible to make them configurable, especially if different environments require different extensions.
