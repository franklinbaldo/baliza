## `baliza/dbt_baliza/models/gold/mart_compras_beneficios.sql`

*   **Hardcoded `tipo_beneficio_id` Values:** The `beneficios_agregados` CTE uses hardcoded integer values (`1, 2, 3`) for `tipo_beneficio_id` to categorize items with benefits. This is a direct duplication of the enum definition in `baliza/src/baliza/enums.py`. This logic should be centralized, ideally by joining with a dbt seed table derived from the Python enums, or by using a dbt macro that can dynamically generate these mappings. This approach is brittle and prone to inconsistencies if the enum values change.
*   **`unique_key='numero_controle_pncp'` with `delete+insert`:** While `numero_controle_pncp` is likely unique for procurements, using `delete+insert` for an incremental strategy can be inefficient for large tables. Consider `merge` or `append` with a unique constraint if applicable.
*   **Reliance on `data_publicacao_pncp` for Incremental Logic:** The incremental logic relies on `data_publicacao_pncp`. This assumes that `data_publicacao_pncp` is always increasing and that new procurements are always "newer" than existing ones. If data can be backfilled or updated out of order, this incremental strategy might miss or duplicate records.
*   **Implicit Data Quality Assumptions:** The model performs calculations like `valor_total_com_beneficio / c.valor_total_estimado` with a `CASE` statement to handle division by zero. This implicitly assumes that `valor_total_estimado` can be zero. Explicit data quality checks and tests should be implemented to ensure the integrity of these calculations.
*   **No Column Descriptions:** New columns created in this model (e.g., `quantidade_total_itens`, `valor_total_com_beneficio`, `percentual_itens_com_beneficio`) do not have descriptions defined within the model or in a corresponding `yml` file. This makes it harder to understand the purpose and content of these columns for downstream users.
*   **Redundant `schema='gold'` in Config:** The `schema='gold'` is already defined in `dbt_project.yml` for the `gold` layer. This is redundant and can be removed.
