*   **Materialized as View:** The model is materialized as a `view`. While this is fine for small datasets or infrequent access, for large datasets or frequent access, materializing as a `table` or `incremental` table would improve performance. The comment indicates it's for "insights into storage optimization," which might imply infrequent access, but it's worth considering the performance implications.
*   **Implicit Dependency on `pncp_content` Table:** The model directly queries `{{ source('pncp', 'pncp_content') }}`. This creates a tight coupling with the `pncp_content` table and its schema. Any changes to the `pncp_content` table schema would require changes in this model.
*   **Hardcoded Calculations:** The calculations for `deduplication_rate_percent`, `storage_savings_percent`, and `compression_ratio` are hardcoded. While these are standard metrics, if the underlying data structure or the definition of "deduplication" changes, these calculations would need to be manually updated.
*   **Lack of Granularity in Analysis:** The analysis provides overall metrics for the entire `pncp_content` table. It does not provide a way to analyze content deduplication for specific endpoints, date ranges, or other dimensions. This limits the usefulness of the analysis for targeted optimization efforts.
*   **Use of `MEDIAN`:** The use of `MEDIAN` might have performance implications on very large datasets, depending on the underlying DuckDB implementation. If performance becomes an issue, consider alternative ways to approximate or calculate median.
*   **No Versioning for Analysis:** The `analysis_timestamp` is the only metadata about when the analysis was performed. There's no versioning for the analysis itself, which means it's hard to track changes in the analysis logic over time.
