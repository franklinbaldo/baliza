## `loader.py`

*   **Hardcoded Schema Name:** The `export_to_parquet` function has the schema name 'gold' hardcoded. This should be configurable.
*   **Lack of Error Handling:** The `upload_to_internet_archive` function does not have any error handling for the `upload` call, which could fail due to network issues or invalid credentials. The `duckdb.connect` call also lacks error handling.
*   **Mixing UI and Logic:** The use of `typer.echo` mixes presentation logic with the core data loading functionality. This module should use logging instead, leaving the user-facing output to the `cli.py` module.
*   **Hardcoded Paths:** The `DATA_DIR` and `PARQUET_DIR` are hardcoded. These should be managed via the central configuration to make the component more reusable.
*   **Brittle Metadata Generation:** The title for the Internet Archive upload is dynamically generated using existing metadata (`item.metadata['updatedate']`). This will fail if the `get_item` call fails or if the metadata field is missing.
