## `pyproject.toml`

*   **Redundant `dependency-groups` and `project.optional-dependencies`:** The file uses both `[project.optional-dependencies]` and `[dependency-groups]` for defining optional dependencies. While `dependency-groups` is a newer feature in `uv` (which is the primary package manager for this project), `project.optional-dependencies` is the standard way to define optional dependencies in `pyproject.toml` for tools like `pip`. This redundancy can lead to confusion and potential inconsistencies. It would be better to standardize on one approach.
*   **Inconsistent `dbt` Dependency Definition:** The `dbt` and `analytics` optional dependency groups both define `dbt-core` and `dbt-duckdb`. This is redundant and could be simplified by having `analytics` depend on `dbt` if `dbt` is a subset of `analytics`.
*   **Overly Broad Ruff Ignores:** The `[tool.ruff.lint.ignore]` section contains several broad ignores (e.g., `S101`, `S603`, `S607`, `S608`, `BLE001`). While some might be justified (like `E501` for line length if an auto-formatter is used), others like `S608` (Possible SQL injection vector) and `BLE001` (Do not catch blind exception) are security and reliability concerns that should ideally be addressed in the code rather than ignored globally. The comment for `S608` ("we use DuckDB safely") is an assertion that should be backed by rigorous testing and code review, not a global ignore.
*   **Mixing of Test Types in `pytest.ini_options`:** The `pytest.ini_options` explicitly sets `testpaths = ["tests"]` and then attempts to filter for E2E tests using markers. While the philosophy states "E2E tests only, no unit tests," the `tests` directory might still contain non-E2E tests or fixtures that are not explicitly marked. It would be clearer to have a dedicated `tests/e2e` directory and set `testpaths = ["tests/e2e"]` if only E2E tests are intended to be run by default.
*   **Implicit `h2` Dependency:** The `httpx` library is listed as a dependency, and `h2` is listed separately for HTTP/2 support. `httpx` can work without `h2`, but `h2` provides HTTP/2 capabilities. This is fine, but the comment "HTTP/2 support for httpx" is a bit vague. It would be clearer to state that `h2` is an *optional* dependency for HTTP/2 support, or to make it a direct dependency of `httpx` if HTTP/2 is strictly required.
*   **`pandas` Version Pinning:** `pandas>=2.3.1` is specified. While this ensures a minimum version, it doesn't pin to a specific major/minor version, which could lead to unexpected behavior if future `pandas` versions introduce breaking changes. Consider using a more restrictive version range (e.g., `pandas~=2.3.1`) or pinning to a specific version for better reproducibility.
