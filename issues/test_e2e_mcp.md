# Analysis of `tests/test_e2e_mcp.py`

This file contains end-to-end tests for the BALIZA MCP server.

## Issues Found

1.  **Direct Logic Imports:** The tests import and call the logic functions directly (e.g., `_available_datasets_logic`, `_dataset_schema_logic`, `_execute_sql_query_logic`). This is not a true end-to-end test of the server, as it bypasses the HTTP interface. A better approach would be to use an HTTP client to make requests to the running server.
2.  **No Server Fixture:** The tests don't have a fixture to start and stop the MCP server. This means the tests are not testing the server in a realistic environment.
3.  **Hardcoded Table Names:** The tests use hardcoded table names (e.g., `pncp_raw_responses`, `psa.pncp_extraction_tasks`). This makes the tests less flexible if the schema changes.
4.  **No `main` function:** The tests are defined as top-level functions. It would be better to group them into a test class to share fixtures and helper methods.
5.  **Lack of fixtures:** The tests could be improved by using pytest fixtures to set up and tear down the test environment, such as creating a temporary database file.
6.  **`BALIZA_DB_PATH` is not used consistently:** The `BALIZA_DB_PATH` variable is used to skip tests if the database file doesn't exist, but it's not used to connect to the database in the tests.
7.  **No cleanup:** The tests do not clean up the created database file after the tests are finished. This can lead to issues with subsequent test runs.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Use an HTTP Client:** Use a library like `httpx` to make requests to the running MCP server. This will provide a more realistic end-to-end test.
*   **Create a Server Fixture:** Create a pytest fixture to start and stop the MCP server in a separate process. This will allow the tests to run against a live server.
*   **Use Fixtures for Database:** Use pytest fixtures to create a temporary database file and populate it with test data. This will make the tests more self-contained and reproducible.
*   **Group Tests in a Class:** Group the tests into a test class to share fixtures and helper methods.
*   **Use `BALIZA_DB_PATH` consistently:** Use the `BALIZA_DB_PATH` variable consistently to connect to the database in the tests.
*   **Add Cleanup:** Add a fixture to clean up the created database file after the tests are finished.

Overall, the tests are a good start, but they could be significantly improved by testing the server through its HTTP interface and using fixtures to manage the test environment. This will make the tests more robust, realistic, and maintainable.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Create a `test_mcp_server.py` file in a `tests/` directory at the root of the project.**
*   **Use an `httpx.AsyncClient` fixture:**
    *   Create a fixture that returns an `httpx.AsyncClient` instance.
    *   Use the client to make requests to the MCP server.
*   **Use a `server` fixture:**
    *   Create a fixture that starts the MCP server in a separate process.
    *   Use the `server` fixture in the tests.
    *   Stop the server after the tests are finished.
*   **Use a `tmp_db` fixture:**
    *   Create a fixture that creates a temporary database file and populates it with test data.
    *   Use the temporary database file in the tests.
    *   Clean up the temporary database file after the tests are finished.
*   **Group tests in a `TestMcpServer` class:**
    *   Group the tests into a `TestMcpServer` class.
    *   Use the `client`, `server`, and `tmp_db` fixtures in the class.
*   **Add more comprehensive tests:**
    *   Add tests to verify the responses from the MCP server.
    *   Add tests to verify the security of the MCP server (e.g., preventing SQL injection).
