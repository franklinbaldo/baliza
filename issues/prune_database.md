# Analysis of `scripts/prune_database.py`

This script is a comprehensive database pruning and optimization tool. It's well-structured and uses modern libraries like `rich` for a good user experience.

## Issues Found

1.  **Hardcoded Paths:** The default `db_path` is hardcoded. While it can be overridden by a command-line argument, the default value is not very flexible.
2.  **Hardcoded Table Names:** The table names are hardcoded in the SQL queries. This makes the script less flexible if the schema changes.
3.  **Bare `except Exception`:** Several methods use a bare `except Exception`, which is too broad. It's better to catch more specific exceptions.
4.  **Noisy `main` function:** The `main` function does not have a docstring that explains what it does.
5.  **Redundant `if self.conn`:** The `finally` blocks in `analyze_database_content`, `prune_old_records`, `clean_orphaned_content`, and `vacuum_database` have a redundant `if self.conn` check. The `self.conn.close()` call can be made directly, as it will do nothing if the connection is already closed.
6.  **Potential for large memory usage:** The `analyze_current_state` function reads all file paths into memory, which could be an issue for directories with a very large number of files.
7.  **No confirmation for aggressive pruning:** The `prune_old_records` function has a condition for aggressive pruning (`keep_days < 30`), but it doesn't ask for user confirmation before proceeding. It currently skips the operation with a warning, which is safe but could be improved.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Configuration:** Make table names and other settings configurable, either through command-line arguments or a configuration file.
*   **Specific Exception Handling:** Use more specific exception handling to provide better error messages and make the script more robust.
*   **Add docstrings:** Add a docstring to the `main` function to explain its purpose.
*   **Remove redundant code:** Remove the redundant `if self.conn` checks in the `finally` blocks.
*   **Memory Optimization:** For very large directories, consider using an iterator-based approach to process files instead of loading them all into memory at once.
*   **User Confirmation:** For destructive operations like aggressive pruning, add a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental data loss.
*   **Code Organization:** The script is quite long. It could be beneficial to break it down into smaller, more focused modules (e.g., for file operations, database operations, and reporting).

Overall, this is a very good script that demonstrates a solid understanding of database maintenance and optimization. The suggestions above are minor and aimed at further improving its robustness and usability.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Refactor `DatabasePruner`:**
    *   Move the `DatabasePruner` class to a separate `pruner.py` file.
    *   Move the `analyze_current_state`, `analyze_database_content`, and `print_summary` methods to a separate `reporting.py` file.
    *   Move the database interaction logic to a separate `db.py` file.
*   **Add a `main` function:**
    *   Use `argparse` to add command-line arguments for the database path, keep days, and remove backups flag.
    *   Allow loading table names from a configuration file.
*   **Refactor `prune_old_records` and `clean_orphaned_content`:**
    *   Use more specific exception handling for database operations.
    *   Add a confirmation prompt for aggressive pruning.
