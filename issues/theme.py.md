# Analysis of `src/baliza/ui/theme.py`

This file defines the theme system for the BALIZA CLI.

## Architectural Issues

None. This is a well-defined theme module with a clear purpose.

## Code Quality Issues

1.  **Global Theme Instance:** The use of a global theme instance (`_theme_instance`) is not ideal. It would be better to pass the theme object as a parameter to the functions that need it.
2.  **Duplicate Code:** There is some duplicate code for getting icons and colors. This could be refactored into a helper function.
3.  **Noisy `BalızaTheme` class:** The `BalızaTheme` class does not have a docstring that explains what it does.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Pass Theme as a Parameter:** Pass the theme object as a parameter to the functions that need it, instead of using a global instance.
*   **Refactor Duplicate Code:** Refactor the duplicate code for getting icons and colors into a helper function.
*   **Add docstrings:** Add a docstring to the `BalızaTheme` class to explain its purpose.

Overall, the `theme.py` file is a well-written and functional theme module. The suggestions above are aimed at improving its flexibility and maintainability.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Create a `Theme` class:**
    *   This class will be responsible for defining the theme of the application.
    *   It will have attributes for colors, icons, and styles.
*   **Refactor theme functions:**
    *   The theme functions will take a `Theme` object as input.
    *   They will use the `Theme` object to get the styles for the components.
*   **Refactor duplicate code:**
    *   Create a `_get_asset` helper function to get icons and colors.
*   **Add docstrings and type hints to all classes and functions.**
