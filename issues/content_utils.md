# Analysis of `src/baliza/content_utils.py`

This file provides utility functions for content analysis and deduplication.

## Architectural Issues

None. This is a well-defined utility module with a clear purpose.

## Code Quality Issues

1.  **Hardcoded Hash Algorithm:** The `generate_content_hash` and `analyze_content` functions have a hardcoded default value for the `hash_algorithm` parameter. This makes the code less flexible if you want to use a different hash algorithm.
2.  **Noisy `if __name__ == "__main__"` block:** The `if __name__ == "__main__"` block contains test code that is not part of a formal test suite. This makes the code harder to test and maintain.
3.  **Unused `CONTENT_ID_LENGTH` and `CONTENT_HASH_LENGTH` constants:** The `CONTENT_ID_LENGTH` and `CONTENT_HASH_LENGTH` constants are defined but never used.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Make Hash Algorithm Configurable:** The hash algorithm should be configurable, for example, through a setting in the `config.py` file.
*   **Move Test Code to a Test Suite:** The test code in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block should be moved to a separate test file in the `tests` directory.
*   **Remove Unused Constants:** The `CONTENT_ID_LENGTH` and `CONTENT_HASH_LENGTH` constants should be removed if they are not being used.

Overall, the `content_utils.py` file is a well-written and functional utility module. The suggestions above are aimed at improving its flexibility and maintainability.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Make Hash Algorithm Configurable:**
    *   Add a `hash_algorithm` setting to the `config.py` file.
    *   Use the `hash_algorithm` setting in the `generate_content_hash` and `analyze_content` functions.
*   **Move Test Code to a Test Suite:**
    *   Create a `test_content_utils.py` file in the `tests` directory.
    *   Move the test code from the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block to the `test_content_utils.py` file.
*   **Remove Unused Constants:**
    *   Remove the `CONTENT_ID_LENGTH` and `CONTENT_HASH_LENGTH` constants.
*   **Add docstrings and type hints to all functions.**
