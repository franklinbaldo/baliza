# Analysis of `src/baliza/extractor.py`

This file contains the `AsyncPNCPExtractor` class, which is a refactored version of the original extractor.

## Architectural Issues

1.  **Incomplete Refactoring:** The `AsyncPNCPExtractor` class still has some of the same responsibilities as the original extractor. For example, it still instantiates the `PNCPWriter`, `TaskClaimer`, and `DbtRunner`. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the class harder to test.
2.  **Noisy `logger` variable:** The `logger` variable is created but it is not used in the whole file.

## Code Quality Issues

None. The code is well-written and follows best practices.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Complete the Refactoring:** The `AsyncPNCPExtractor` class should be refactored to be a simple orchestrator that delegates to the `ExtractionCoordinator`. The `PNCPWriter`, `TaskClaimer`, and `DbtRunner` should be instantiated in the `ExtractionCoordinator` and passed to the `AsyncPNCPExtractor` as dependencies.
*   **Remove unused variables:** The `logger` variable is not used anywhere in the file and should be removed.

Overall, the `extractor.py` file is a good step in the right direction, but it needs to be completed to fully address the architectural issues of the original extractor. The suggestions above will help to make the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Refactor `AsyncPNCPExtractor`:**
    *   The `AsyncPNCPExtractor` class will be responsible for orchestrating the extraction process.
    *   It will use the `ExtractionCoordinator` to run the extraction.
    *   It will not instantiate any other classes.
*   **Remove unused variables:**
    *   Remove the `logger` variable.
*   **Add docstrings and type hints to all methods.**
