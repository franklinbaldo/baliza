# Analysis of `src/baliza/pncp_writer.py`

This file contains the `PNCPWriter` class, which is responsible for writing data to the DuckDB database.

## Architectural Issues

1.  **Dual Responsibility:** The `PNCPWriter` class has a dual responsibility. It manages the database connection and schema, and it also contains the logic for storing data in the database. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle.
2.  **Backwards Compatibility:** The `_store_legacy_response` method stores data in a legacy table for backwards compatibility. This adds complexity to the code and makes it harder to maintain. It would be better to have a separate migration script to handle data from the legacy table.
3.  **Mixing of Concerns:** The `_init_database` method mixes database initialization with schema migration. This makes the method long and difficult to understand. It would be better to have a separate method for schema migration.
4.  **Hardcoded SQL:** The SQL queries are hardcoded as strings. This makes them difficult to maintain and test. They should be moved to separate `.sql` files or a dedicated query module.

## Code Quality Issues

1.  **Complex Methods:** Some of the methods in the `PNCPWriter` class are too long and complex, such as `_init_database` and `_batch_store_split_tables`. They should be broken down into smaller, more focused methods.
2.  **Lack of Comments:** The code lacks comments, especially in the more complex parts. This makes it difficult to understand the logic and the intent of the code.
3.  **Inconsistent Naming:** The naming of variables and methods is not always consistent. For example, some variables are in `snake_case` and others are in `camelCase`.
4.  **Noisy `_index_exists` method:** The `_index_exists` method does not have a docstring that explains what it does.
5.  **Unused `console` variable:** The `console` variable is created but it is not used in the whole file.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Separate Responsibilities:** Create a separate `DatabaseManager` class to handle the database connection and schema. The `PNCPWriter` class should then use the `DatabaseManager` to write data to the database.
*   **Remove Backwards Compatibility:** Remove the `_store_legacy_response` method and create a separate migration script to handle data from the legacy table.
*   **Separate Schema Migration:** Move the schema migration logic to a separate method or script.
*   **Externalize SQL Queries:** Move the SQL queries to separate `.sql` files or a dedicated query module.
*   **Refactor Complex Methods:** Break down the complex methods into smaller, more focused methods.
*   **Add Comments:** Add comments to the code to explain the logic and the intent of the code.
*   **Use Consistent Naming:** Use a consistent naming convention for variables and methods.
*   **Add docstrings:** Add docstrings to all methods to explain their purpose.
*   **Remove unused variables:** The `console` variable is not used anywhere in the file and should be removed.

Overall, the `pncp_writer.py` file is a good starting point, but it needs a significant refactoring to improve its architecture and code quality. The suggestions above will help to make the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Create a `DatabaseManager` class:**
    *   This class will be responsible for managing the database connection and schema.
    *   It will have methods for connecting to the database, creating tables, and creating indexes.
    *   It will also have a method for migrating the schema to use ZSTD compression.
*   **Refactor `PNCPWriter`:**
    *   The `PNCPWriter` class will be responsible for writing data to the database.
    *   It will use the `DatabaseManager` to connect to the database.
    *   It will have methods for storing responses in the split table architecture.
    *   The `_store_legacy_response` method will be removed.
*   **Externalize SQL Queries:**
    *   Move the SQL queries to separate `.sql` files.
    *   Use a query builder or an ORM to build the queries.
*   **Remove unused variables:**
    *   Remove the `console` variable.
*   **Add docstrings and type hints to all methods.**
