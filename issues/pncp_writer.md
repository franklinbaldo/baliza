## `pncp_writer.py`

*   **Monolithic `_init_database` Method:** The `_init_database` method is responsible for creating the schema, tables, indexes, and migrating the data. This should be broken down into smaller, more focused methods.
*   **Lack of a Migration Framework:** The database schema is managed manually. Using a migration framework like Alembic would make it easier to manage schema changes over time.
*   **Hardcoded SQL:** The file contains a lot of hardcoded SQL queries. These should be moved to a separate file or a data access layer to make them easier to manage and test.
*   **Mixing of Concerns:** The `PNCPWriter` class is responsible for both writing data to the database and managing the database schema. These concerns should be separated.
*   **Leaky Abstraction:** The `connect_utf8` function is a leaky abstraction. It tries to handle the `force_db` logic, but it also prints to the console, which is a UI concern.
*   **Complex `_batch_store_split_tables` Method:** This method is very long and complex, with multiple steps and nested logic. It should be broken down into smaller, more focused methods.
*   **Backwards Compatibility:** The `_store_legacy_response` method is a good example of how to maintain backwards compatibility, but it adds complexity to the code. A better approach would be to have a separate migration script that runs once to migrate the data from the old schema to the new schema.
