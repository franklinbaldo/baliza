# Analysis of `tests/test_e2e_extraction.py`

This file contains end-to-end tests for the BALIZA extraction pipeline.

## Issues Found

1.  **Hardcoded Dates:** The tests use hardcoded dates (e.g., `date(2024, 1, 15)`). This can make the tests brittle if the data for that date changes or becomes unavailable.
2.  **No `main` function:** The tests are defined as top-level functions. It would be better to group them into a test class to share fixtures and helper methods.
3.  **Lack of fixtures:** The tests could be improved by using pytest fixtures to set up and tear down the test environment, such as creating a temporary database file.
4.  **`BALIZA_DB_PATH` is not used consistently:** The `BALIZA_DB_PATH` variable is used to skip tests if the database file doesn't exist, but it's not used to connect to the database in the tests.
5.  **No cleanup:** The tests do not clean up the created database file after the tests are finished. This can lead to issues with subsequent test runs.
6.  **Redundant `connect_utf8` calls:** The `connect_utf8` function is called multiple times in each test. It would be better to use a fixture to create a single database connection for each test.
7.  **Incomplete Schema Validation:** The `test_e2e_validate_response_schema` test only validates the schema of the `contratos` endpoint. It should be extended to validate the schemas of all the endpoints that are being tested.
8.  **Hardcoded Table Names:** The tests use hardcoded table names (e.g., `psa.pncp_extraction_tasks`, `psa.pncp_raw_responses`). This makes the tests less flexible if the schema changes.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Use a Date Range:** Instead of using a single hardcoded date, use a date range to make the tests more robust.
*   **Group Tests in a Class:** Group the tests into a test class to share fixtures and helper methods.
*   **Use Fixtures for Database:** Use pytest fixtures to create a temporary database file and populate it with test data. This will make the tests more self-contained and reproducible.
*   **Use `BALIZA_DB_PATH` consistently:** Use the `BALIZA_DB_PATH` variable consistently to connect to the database in the tests.
*   **Add Cleanup:** Add a fixture to clean up the created database file after the tests are finished.
*   **Use a Database Connection Fixture:** Create a fixture that provides a single database connection for each test.
*   **Extend Schema Validation:** Extend the `test_e2e_validate_response_schema` test to validate the schemas of all the endpoints that are being tested.
*   **Use Configuration for Table Names:** Use a configuration file or a fixture to provide the table names to the tests. This will make the tests more flexible if the schema changes.

Overall, the tests are a good start, but they could be significantly improved by using more of pytest's features to make them more robust, maintainable, and easier to read. The suggestions above will help to improve the quality and effectiveness of the tests.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Create a `test_extraction.py` file in a `tests/` directory at the root of the project.**
*   **Use a `tmp_db` fixture:**
    *   Create a fixture that creates a temporary database file.
    *   Use the temporary database file in the tests.
    *   Clean up the temporary database file after the tests are finished.
*   **Use a `db_conn` fixture:**
    *   Create a fixture that returns a connection to the temporary database.
*   **Group tests in a `TestExtraction` class:**
    *   Group the tests into a `TestExtraction` class.
    *   Use the `tmp_db` and `db_conn` fixtures in the class.
*   **Add more comprehensive tests:**
    *   Add tests to verify the data that is extracted and stored in the database.
    *   Add tests to verify the resumability of the extraction process.
    *   Add tests to verify the schema of the extracted data for all endpoints.
