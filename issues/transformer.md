## `transformer.py`

*   **Hardcoded dbt Command:** The `transform` function hardcodes the `dbt` command and its arguments (`run`, `--project-dir`, `dbt_baliza`). This makes it difficult to configure the dbt command for different environments or use cases. The dbt command should be configurable.
*   **Mixing UI and Logic:** The use of `typer.echo` and `typer.secho` mixes presentation logic with the core transformation functionality. This module should use logging instead, leaving the user-facing output to the `cli.py` module.
*   **Direct Subprocess Execution:** The module directly executes a subprocess (`dbt`). This couples the application to the `dbt` CLI tool. A more robust solution would be to use a dbt API or a more abstract interface to interact with dbt.
*   **Limited Error Handling:** The error handling is basic and only catches `FileNotFoundError` and a general `Exception`. More specific error handling could be implemented to provide more informative error messages to the user.
