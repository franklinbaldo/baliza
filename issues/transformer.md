# Analysis of `src/baliza/transformer.py`

This file contains the `transform` function, which is responsible for running the dbt transformation process.

## Architectural Issues

1.  **Hardcoded dbt Command:** The dbt command is hardcoded as a list of strings. This makes it difficult to maintain and test. It should be moved to a separate configuration file or a dedicated dbt module.
2.  **Noisy `logger` variable:** The `logger` variable is created but it is not used in the whole file.

## Code Quality Issues

1.  **Bare `except Exception`:** The `transform` function uses a bare `except Exception`, which is too broad. It's better to catch more specific exceptions.
2.  **Noisy `transform` function:** The `transform` function does not have a docstring that explains what it does.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Externalize dbt Command:** Move the dbt command to a separate configuration file or a dedicated dbt module.
*   **Remove unused variables:** The `logger` variable is not used anywhere in the file and should be removed.
*   **Specific Exception Handling:** Use more specific exception handling to provide better error messages and make the script more robust.
*   **Add docstrings:** Add a docstring to the `transform` function to explain its purpose.

Overall, the `transformer.py` file is a good starting point, but it needs a significant refactoring to improve its architecture and code quality. The suggestions above will help to make the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Create a `DbtRunner` class:**
    *   This class will be responsible for running dbt commands.
    *   It will have a `run` method that takes a command as input and runs it using `subprocess.run`.
    *   It will have error handling for the `subprocess.run` call.
*   **Refactor `transform`:**
    *   The `transform` function will be responsible for transforming the data.
    *   It will use the `DbtRunner` to run the dbt command.
    *   It will take the dbt command as an argument.
*   **Remove unused variables:**
    *   Remove the `logger` variable.
*   **Add docstrings and type hints to all functions.**
