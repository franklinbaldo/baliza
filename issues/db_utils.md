# Analysis of `src/baliza/db_utils.py`

This file provides utility functions for connecting to the database and executing SQL from a file.

## Architectural Issues

None. This is a well-defined utility module with a clear purpose.

## Code Quality Issues

1.  **Complex `connect_db` Function:** The `connect_db` function is too complex. It has multiple nested `try...except` blocks and a complex logic for handling the `force` flag. This makes the function difficult to understand and maintain.
2.  **Noisy `logger` variable:** The `logger` variable is created but it is not used in the whole file.
3.  **Noisy `console` variable:** The `console` variable is created but it is not used in the whole file.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Simplify `connect_db` Function:** The `connect_db` function should be simplified. The logic for handling the `force` flag could be extracted into a separate function. The nested `try...except` blocks could be replaced with a single `try...except` block that catches all `duckdb.Error` exceptions.
*   **Remove unused variables:** The `logger` and `console` variables are not used anywhere in the file and should be removed.

Overall, the `db_utils.py` file is a functional utility module, but it could be improved by simplifying the `connect_db` function and removing the unused variables. The suggestions above will help to make the code more readable, maintainable, and easier to understand.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Refactor `connect_db`:**
    *   Create a separate function to handle the logic for the `force` flag.
    *   Use a single `try...except` block to catch all `duckdb.Error` exceptions.
    *   Add a docstring and type hints to the function.
*   **Remove unused variables:**
    *   Remove the `logger` and `console` variables.
*   **Add docstrings and type hints to all functions.**
