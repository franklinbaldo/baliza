## `mcp.py`: Deprecated File

### Problem

The file `src/baliza/mcp.py` is deprecated and its contents indicate that the MCP logic is now handled by `mcp_server.py`.

### Potential Solutions

1.  **Delete the File**:
    *   The file should be deleted to avoid confusion and reduce clutter in the codebase.
    *   Before deleting, a quick search should be done to ensure that no other part of the application is still importing it.

### Recommendation

Delete the file `src/baliza/mcp.py`.
