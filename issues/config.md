# Analysis of `src/baliza/config.py`

This file manages the application's configuration using Pydantic's `BaseSettings`.

## Architectural Issues

1.  **Hardcoded Configuration File Path:** The `load_config` function has a hardcoded default path to the `endpoints.yaml` file. This makes the code less flexible and harder to test.
2.  **Mixing Configuration Sources:** The code mixes configuration from environment variables, a `.env` file, and a YAML file. This can make it difficult to understand where a particular configuration value is coming from.
3.  **Noisy `ModalidadeContratacao` import:** The `ModalidadeContratacao` enum is imported but never used.

## Code Quality Issues

None. The code is well-written and follows best practices for configuration management.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Make Configuration File Path Configurable:** The path to the `endpoints.yaml` file should be configurable, for example, through an environment variable or a command-line argument.
*   **Clarify Configuration Precedence:** The documentation should clearly state the precedence of the different configuration sources (e.g., environment variables override `.env` file, which overrides YAML file).
*   **Remove Unused Imports:** The `ModalidadeContratacao` import should be removed if it's not being used.

Overall, the `config.py` file is a well-designed and robust configuration module. The suggestions above are aimed at improving its flexibility and clarity.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Make Configuration File Path Configurable:**
    *   Add a `config_path` setting to the `Settings` class.
    *   Use the `config_path` setting in the `load_config` function.
*   **Clarify Configuration Precedence in the Docstring:**
    *   Add a section to the `Settings` docstring that explains the precedence of the different configuration sources.
*   **Remove Unused Imports:**
    *   Remove the `ModalidadeContratacao` import.
*   **Add docstrings and type hints to all functions.**
