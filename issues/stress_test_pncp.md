# Analysis of `scripts/stress_test_pncp.py`

This script is a stress tester for the PNCP API. It's well-structured and uses modern libraries like `httpx`, `rich`, and `asyncio`.

## Issues Found

1.  **Hardcoded Test Endpoints:** The `test_endpoints` are hardcoded within the `test_configuration` method. This makes it inflexible if you want to test other endpoints.
2.  **Hardcoded Test Configurations:** The script has a hardcoded list of `TestConfig` objects. This makes it difficult to experiment with different configurations without modifying the script. It would be better to allow these to be configured via command-line arguments or a configuration file.
3.  **Noisy Output:** The script prints a lot of information to the console. While this is useful for interactive use, it might be too verbose for automated runs. A `--quiet` or `--verbose` flag would be beneficial.
4.  **Fixed Test Duration:** The test duration is hardcoded in the `TestConfig` dataclass. This should be configurable.
5.  **Task Collection Logic:** The task collection logic in `test_configuration` is a bit complex and might not be the most efficient way to handle a large number of tasks. Using a queue or a different task management pattern could simplify this.
6.  **Redundant `logger` variable:** The `logger` variable is created but it is not used in the whole file.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Command-Line Arguments:** Use a library like `argparse` or `typer` to allow configuration of test parameters (concurrency, delay, duration, endpoints, etc.) from the command line.
*   **Configuration File:** Allow loading test configurations from a YAML or JSON file for more complex test scenarios.
*   **Output Formatting:** Add options for different output formats, such as JSON or CSV, to make it easier to parse the results programmatically.
*   **Quieter Mode:** Add a `--quiet` flag to suppress non-essential output.
*   **Task Management:** Refactor the task management logic to be more robust and efficient. For example, using a producer-consumer pattern with a queue.
*   **Code Organization:** The script is quite long. It could be broken down into smaller, more focused modules (e.g., `config.py`, `tester.py`, `reporting.py`).
*   **Remove unused variables:** The `logger` variable is not used anywhere in the file and should be removed.

Overall, the script is well-written and serves its purpose. The suggestions above are mostly for improving its flexibility, usability, and maintainability.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Refactor `PNCPStressTester`:**
    *   Move the `TestConfig` and `TestResult` dataclasses to a separate `models.py` file.
    *   Move the `PNCPStressTester` class to a separate `tester.py` file.
    *   Move the `analyze_and_report` and `save_results` methods to a separate `reporting.py` file.
*   **Add a `main` function:**
    *   Use `argparse` to add command-line arguments for the test parameters.
    *   Allow loading test configurations from a YAML or JSON file.
    *   Add a `--quiet` flag to suppress non-essential output.
    *   Add options for different output formats (e.g., JSON, CSV).
*   **Refactor `test_configuration`:**
    *   Use a queue to manage the tasks.
    *   Use a producer-consumer pattern to create and process the tasks.
