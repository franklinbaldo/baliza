# Analysis of `src/baliza/pncp_task_planner.py`

This file contains the `PNCPTaskPlanner` class, which is responsible for planning data extraction tasks.

## Issues Found

1.  **Hardcoded Table Name:** The table name `psa.pncp_extraction_tasks` is hardcoded in the `plan_tasks` method. This makes the script less flexible if the schema changes.
2.  **Bare `except Exception`:** The `plan_tasks` method uses a bare `except Exception`, which is too broad. It's better to catch more specific exceptions.
3.  **No Logging Configuration:** The script uses the `logging` module, but it doesn't configure it. This means that the log messages will not be displayed unless the calling script configures the logging module.
4.  **Noisy `_format_date` method:** The `_format_date` method does not have a docstring that explains what it does.
5.  **Noisy `_monthly_chunks` method:** The `_monthly_chunks` method does not have a docstring that explains what it does.
6.  **Unused `settings` attribute:** The `settings` attribute is passed to the `__init__` method, but it's not used anywhere in the class.
7.  **Complex Logic in `plan_tasks`:** The `plan_tasks` method is quite long and contains complex logic for generating task IDs and handling different endpoint configurations. This could be simplified and broken down into smaller, more focused methods.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Configuration:** Make the table name configurable, either through a parameter or a configuration file.
*   **Specific Exception Handling:** Use more specific exception handling to provide better error messages and make the script more robust.
*   **Logging Configuration:** Configure the `logging` module to ensure that log messages are displayed.
*   **Add docstrings:** Add docstrings to the `_format_date` and `_monthly_chunks` methods to explain their purpose.
*   **Remove unused attributes:** Remove the unused `settings` attribute.
*   **Refactor `plan_tasks`:** Refactor the `plan_tasks` method to be more modular and easier to read. For example, the task ID generation logic could be extracted into a separate method.
*   **Type Hinting:** The `__init__` method could have type hints for its parameters.

Overall, the `PNCPTaskPlanner` class is functional, but it could be improved by following best practices for code organization, error handling, and logging. The suggestions above will help to make the code more robust, maintainable, and easier to understand.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Refactor `PNCPTaskPlanner`:**
    *   Move the `PNCPTaskPlanner` class to a separate `planner.py` file.
    *   Move the database interaction logic to a separate `db.py` file.
*   **Refactor `plan_tasks`:**
    *   Use a configuration file to get the active endpoints.
    *   Use a separate method to generate the task ID.
    *   Use more specific exception handling for database operations.
    *   Add a docstring and type hints to the function.
*   **Add a `main` function:**
    *   Use `argparse` to add command-line arguments for the start date and end date.
    *   Use a logging library to log the progress of the script.
