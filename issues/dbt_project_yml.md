## `baliza/dbt_baliza/dbt_project.yml`

*   **Redundant Endpoint Definitions:** The `endpoints` variable in `dbt_project.yml` duplicates the endpoint names already defined in `baliza/config/endpoints.yaml`. This redundancy can lead to inconsistencies if new endpoints are added or existing ones are renamed in one place but not the other. The `endpoints.yaml` should be the single source of truth for endpoint configurations, and dbt should ideally read from that.
*   **Hardcoded Materialization Strategies:** While the layered architecture (planning, runtime, analytics, bronze, silver, gold) is good, the materialization strategies (`table`, `view`, `incremental`) are hardcoded for each layer. While these are common defaults, there might be cases where a different materialization is desired for a specific model within a layer. This could be made more flexible by allowing overrides at the model level or by using a more dynamic materialization strategy.
*   **Hardcoded Schema Names:** The schema names (`planning`, `runtime`, `analytics`, `bronze`, `silver`, `gold`, `tests`, `snapshots`, `psa`) are hardcoded. While this is common in dbt, it can make it difficult to deploy the project to environments with different schema naming conventions. These could be made configurable through variables or environment-specific profiles.
*   **`vars` Section Duplication:** The `start_date` and `end_date` variables are defined here, but they are also likely passed as arguments to the `baliza extract` command. This creates a potential for inconsistency if they are not synchronized.
*   **Implicit Dependency on `psa_schema`:** The `psa_schema` variable is defined, but its usage is not immediately clear from this file alone. It's likely used to define the schema for raw data, but its purpose and interaction with the `pncp_writer.py` should be documented.
*   **Lack of Versioning for `vars`:** The `vars` section does not have a versioning mechanism. If the structure or meaning of these variables changes over time, it could lead to compatibility issues.
*   **`tests` and `snapshots` Schema Duplication:** The `tests` and `snapshots` schema are defined twice, once in the `models` section and once in their respective top-level sections. This is redundant.
