# Analysis of `src/baliza/ui/errors.py`

This file provides a centralized error handler for the BALIZA application.

## Architectural Issues

1.  **Mixing UI and Logic:** The `ErrorHandler` class mixes UI code (e.g., creating panels and headers) with error handling logic (e.g., handling rate limit errors, database errors, and API errors). This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the code harder to test.
2.  **Hardcoded Error Messages:** The error messages and suggestions are hardcoded as strings. This makes it difficult to internationalize the application or to change the error messages without modifying the code.

## Code Quality Issues

1.  **Long Methods:** Some of the methods in the `ErrorHandler` class are too long and complex, such as `handle_rate_limit_error` and `handle_api_error`. They should be broken down into smaller, more focused methods.
2.  **Noisy `show_recovery_success` method:** The `show_recovery_success` method does not have a docstring that explains what it does.
3.  **Noisy `show_warning` method:** The `show_warning` method does not have a docstring that explains what it does.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Separate UI and Logic:** Create a separate `ErrorFormatter` class to handle the UI for displaying errors. The `ErrorHandler` class should then use the `ErrorFormatter` to display error messages to the user.
*   **Externalize Error Messages:** Move the error messages and suggestions to a separate configuration file (e.g., a YAML or JSON file). This will make it easier to internationalize the application and to change the error messages without modifying the code.
*   **Refactor Long Methods:** Break down the long methods into smaller, more focused methods.
*   **Add docstrings:** Add docstrings to all methods to explain their purpose.

Overall, the `errors.py` file is a good starting point, but it needs a significant refactoring to improve its architecture and code quality. The suggestions above will help to make the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Create an `ErrorFormatter` class:**
    *   This class will be responsible for formatting error messages.
    *   It will have methods for formatting rate limit errors, API errors, and database errors.
*   **Refactor `ErrorHandler`:**
    *   The `ErrorHandler` class will be responsible for handling errors.
    *   It will use the `ErrorFormatter` to format the error messages.
    *   It will have methods for handling rate limit errors, API errors, and database errors.
*   **Externalize Error Messages:**
    *   Move the error messages and suggestions to a separate `errors.yaml` file.
    *   The `ErrorFormatter` will load the error messages from the `errors.yaml` file.
*   **Add docstrings and type hints to all methods.**
