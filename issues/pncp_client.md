# Analysis of `src/baliza/pncp_client.py`

This file contains the `PNCPClient` class, which is responsible for making HTTP requests to the PNCP API.

## Architectural Issues

None. This is a well-defined client module with a clear purpose.

## Code Quality Issues

1.  **Hardcoded Retry Strategy:** The retry strategy is hardcoded in the `__init__` method. This makes it difficult to configure the retry behavior without modifying the code.
2.  **Noisy `logger` variable:** The `logger` variable is created but it is not used in the whole file.
3.  **Noisy `_verify_http2_status` method:** The `_verify_http2_status` method does not have a docstring that explains what it does.
4.  **Noisy `fetch_with_backpressure` method:** The `fetch_with_backpressure` method does not have a docstring that explains what it does.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Make Retry Strategy Configurable:** The retry strategy should be configurable, for example, through a setting in the `config.py` file.
*   **Remove unused variables:** The `logger` variable is not used anywhere in the file and should be removed.
*   **Add docstrings:** Add docstrings to all methods to explain their purpose.

Overall, the `pncp_client.py` file is a well-written and functional client module. The suggestions above are aimed at improving its flexibility and maintainability.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Make Retry Strategy Configurable:**
    *   Add a `retry_strategy` setting to the `config.py` file.
    *   Use the `retry_strategy` setting in the `PNCPClient` class.
*   **Remove unused variables:**
    *   Remove the `logger` variable.
*   **Add docstrings and type hints to all methods.**
