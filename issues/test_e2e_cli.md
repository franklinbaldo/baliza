# Analysis of `tests/test_e2e_cli.py`

This file contains end-to-end tests for the BALIZA CLI interface.

## Issues Found

1.  **Hardcoded Paths:** The `cwd` for `subprocess.run` is hardcoded to `Path(__file__).parent.parent`. This is not very flexible and could be improved by using a fixture to provide the project root path.
2.  **Redundant `uv run`:** The tests use `uv run baliza` to run the CLI. This is redundant, as the tests are already running in a `uv` environment. It would be simpler to run `baliza` directly.
3.  **Noisy Tests:** The tests print a lot of output to the console. While this is useful for debugging, it can make the test output verbose. A `--quiet` or `--verbose` flag would be beneficial.
4.  **No `main` function:** The tests are defined as top-level functions. It would be better to group them into a test class to share fixtures and helper methods.
5.  **Lack of fixtures:** The tests could be improved by using pytest fixtures to set up and tear down the test environment, such as creating a temporary database file.
6.  **`BALIZA_DB_PATH` is not used in `test_e2e_cli_extract_single_day`:** The `test_e2e_cli_extract_single_day` test does not use the `BALIZA_DB_PATH` variable to check if the database file was created.
7.  **No cleanup:** The tests do not clean up the created database file after the tests are finished. This can lead to issues with subsequent test runs.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Use Fixtures:** Use pytest fixtures to provide the project root path, create a temporary database file, and clean up the test environment.
*   **Simplify CLI calls:** Run the CLI directly instead of using `uv run baliza`.
*   **Control Test Output:** Use a command-line flag to control the verbosity of the test output.
*   **Group Tests in a Class:** Group the tests into a test class to share fixtures and helper methods.
*   **Use `BALIZA_DB_PATH` consistently:** Use the `BALIZA_DB_PATH` variable consistently to check for the existence of the database file.
*   **Add Cleanup:** Add a fixture to clean up the created database file after the tests are finished.

Overall, the tests are a good start, but they could be improved by using more of pytest's features to make them more robust, maintainable, and easier to read.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Create a `test_cli.py` file in a `tests/` directory at the root of the project.**
*   **Use a `CliRunner` fixture:**
    *   Create a fixture that returns a `CliRunner` instance.
    *   Use the `CliRunner` to invoke the CLI commands.
*   **Use a `tmp_db` fixture:**
    *   Create a fixture that creates a temporary database file.
    *   Use the temporary database file in the tests.
    *   Clean up the temporary database file after the tests are finished.
*   **Group tests in a `TestCli` class:**
    *   Group the tests into a `TestCli` class.
    *   Use the `CliRunner` and `tmp_db` fixtures in the class.
*   **Add more comprehensive tests:**
    *   Add tests to verify the output of the CLI commands.
    *   Add tests to verify the side effects of the CLI commands (e.g., creating files, modifying the database).
