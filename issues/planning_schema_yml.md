## `baliza/dbt_baliza/models/planning/planning_schema.yml`

*   **Redundant Status Definition:** The `status` column in `task_plan` model defines `accepted_values` for `PENDING`, `CLAIMED`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`. This is a good practice, but these values are also implicitly used as strings in the Python code (e.g., `extractor.py`, `task_claimer.py`). This creates a potential for inconsistency if the values are changed in one place but not the other. Consider defining these status values as constants or enums in a shared location that can be referenced by both dbt and Python.
*   **Implicit `plan_version` Format:** The `plan_version` column in `task_plan_meta` has a description "Environment-prefixed version: {env}-YYYY-MM-DD.N". This format is implicitly defined and not enforced by any validation. While dbt schema tests can check for `not_null` and `unique`, they don't validate the format itself. This could lead to inconsistent versioning if not strictly adhered to.
*   **Hardcoded `environment` Values:** The `environment` column in `task_plan_meta` defines `accepted_values` for `dev`, `staging`, `prod`. These values are also used in `plan_fingerprint.py` and `dbt_project.yml`. This creates a potential for inconsistency if new environments are added or existing ones are renamed. These values should be defined in a central configuration that can be referenced by both dbt and Python.
*   **Lack of Foreign Key Constraints:** While DuckDB might not fully support traditional foreign key constraints in YAML definitions, the relationship between `task_plan` and `task_plan_meta` (via `plan_fingerprint`) is a logical foreign key. Documenting this relationship explicitly (e.g., using dbt's `relationships` test if applicable or custom tests) would improve data integrity understanding.
*   **Description Duplication:** The descriptions for columns like `task_id`, `endpoint_name`, `data_date`, `modalidade`, `status`, and `plan_fingerprint` are repeated across `planning_schema.yml` and potentially in Python code. While some duplication is acceptable for clarity, consider a single source of truth for core data definitions.
