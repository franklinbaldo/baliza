# Analysis of `src/baliza/utils/__init__.py`

This file is the `__init__.py` file for the `utils` package.

## Architectural Issues

None.

## Code Quality Issues

None.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*   **Expose Utility Functions:** The `__init__.py` file could be used to expose the utility functions from the `utils` package. For example, you could add the following line to the file:

    ```python
    from .json_utils import parse_json_robust
    ```

    This would allow users to import the `parse_json_robust` function directly from `baliza.utils` instead of `baliza.utils.json_utils`.

Overall, the `__init__.py` file is a standard part of a Python package and doesn't have any issues. The suggestion above is a matter of style and can be implemented to improve the usability of the package.

## Proposed Solutions

*   **Add the following line to the `__init__.py` file:**

    ```python
    from .json_utils import parse_json_robust
    ```
